<h4 class="subsection">4.11.3 Source Checkout</h4>

<p>The first step of any build is typically to acquire the source code
from which the build will be performed. There are several classes to
handle this, one for each of the different source control system that
Buildbot knows about. For a description of how Buildbot treats source
control in general, see <a href="Version-Control-Systems.html#Version-Control-Systems">Version Control Systems</a>.

   <p>All source checkout steps accept some common parameters to control how
they get the sources and where they should be placed. The remaining
per-VC-system parameters are mostly to specify where exactly the
sources are coming from.

     <dl>
<dt><code>mode</code><dd>
a string describing the kind of VC operation that is desired. Defaults
to <code>update</code>.

          <dl>
<dt><code>update</code><dd>specifies that the CVS checkout/update should be performed directly
into the workdir. Each build is performed in the same directory,
allowing for incremental builds. This minimizes disk space, bandwidth,
and CPU time. However, it may encounter problems if the build process
does not handle dependencies properly (sometimes you must do a &ldquo;clean
build&rdquo; to make sure everything gets compiled), or if source files are
deleted but generated files can influence test behavior (e.g. python's
.pyc files), or when source directories are deleted but generated
files prevent CVS from removing them. Builds ought to be correct
regardless of whether they are done &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; or incrementally,
but it is useful to test both kinds: this mode exercises the
incremental-build style.

          <br><dt><code>copy</code><dd>specifies that the CVS workspace should be maintained in a separate
directory (called the 'copydir'), using checkout or update as
necessary. For each build, a new workdir is created with a copy of the
source tree (rm -rf workdir; cp -r copydir workdir). This doubles the
disk space required, but keeps the bandwidth low (update instead of a
full checkout). A full 'clean' build is performed each time. This
avoids any generated-file build problems, but is still occasionally
vulnerable to CVS problems such as a repository being manually
rearranged, causing CVS errors on update which are not an issue with a
full checkout.

          <!-- TODO: something is screwy about this, revisit. Is it the source -->
          <!-- directory or the working directory that is deleted each time? -->
          <br><dt><code>clobber</code><dd>specifies that the working directory should be deleted each time,
necessitating a full checkout for each build. This insures a clean
build off a complete checkout, avoiding any of the problems described
above. This mode exercises the &ldquo;from-scratch&rdquo; build style.

          <br><dt><code>export</code><dd>this is like <code>clobber</code>, except that the 'cvs export' command is
used to create the working directory. This command removes all CVS
metadata files (the CVS/ directories) from the tree, which is
sometimes useful for creating source tarballs (to avoid including the
metadata in the tar file). 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>workdir</code><dd>like all Steps, this indicates the directory where the build will take
place. Source Steps are special in that they perform some operations
outside of the workdir (like creating the workdir itself).

     <br><dt><code>alwaysUseLatest</code><dd>if True, bypass the usual &ldquo;update to the last Change&rdquo; behavior, and
always update to the latest changes instead.

     <br><dt><code>retry</code><dd>If set, this specifies a tuple of <code>(delay, repeats)</code> which means
that when a full VC checkout fails, it should be retried up to
<var>repeats</var> times, waiting <var>delay</var> seconds between attempts. If
you don't provide this, it defaults to <code>None</code>, which means VC
operations should not be retried. This is provided to make life easier
for buildslaves which are stuck behind poor network connections.

     <br><dt><code>repository</code><dd>The name of this parameter might vary depending on the Source step you
are running. The concept explained here is common to all steps and
applies to <code>repourl</code> as well as for <code>baseURL</code> (when
applicable). Buildbot, now being aware of the repository name via the
ChangeSource step might in some cases not need the repository URL. There
are multiple way to pass it through to this step, corresponding to
the type of the parameter given to this step:

          <dl>
<dt><code>None</code><dd>In the case where no parameter is specified, the repository URL will
be taken directly from the Change property. This value should be used
if your ChangeSource step has all the information about how to reach
the Change.

          <br><dt><code>string</code><dd>The parameter might be a string. In this case, this string will be
used as the full repository URL. The value coming from the
ChangeSource step will be ignored.

          <br><dt><code>format string</code><dd>If the parameter is a string containing <code>%s</code>, then the repository
property from the Change will be substituted in place of the
<code>%s</code>. This is usefull when the ChangeSource step knows where the
repository resides locally, but doesn't know the scheme used to access
it. For instance, <code>ssh://server/%s</code> makes sense if the repository
property is the local path of the repository.

          <br><dt><code>dict</code><dd>In this case, the repository URL will be the value indexed by the
repository property in the dict given as parameter.

          <br><dt><code>callable</code><dd>The callable given as parameter will take the repository property from
the Change and its return value will be used as repository URL.

     </dl>
     </dl>

   <p>Use of WithProperites with string, dict and callable is supported.

   <p>Note that this is quite similar to the mechanism used by the WebStatus
for the <code>changecommentlink</code>, <code>projects</code> or <code>repositories</code> parameter.

   <p>My habit as a developer is to do a <code>cvs update</code> and <code>make</code> each
morning. Problems can occur, either because of bad code being checked in, or
by incomplete dependencies causing a partial rebuild to fail where a
complete from-scratch build might succeed. A quick Builder which emulates
this incremental-build behavior would use the <code>mode='update'</code>
setting.

   <p>On the other hand, other kinds of dependency problems can cause a clean
build to fail where a partial build might succeed. This frequently results
from a link step that depends upon an object file that was removed from a
later version of the tree: in the partial tree, the object file is still
around (even though the Makefiles no longer know how to create it).

   <p>&ldquo;official&rdquo; builds (traceable builds performed from a known set of
source revisions) are always done as clean builds, to make sure it is
not influenced by any uncontrolled factors (like leftover files from a
previous build). A &ldquo;full&rdquo; Builder which behaves this way would want
to use the <code>mode='clobber'</code> setting.

   <p>Each VC system has a corresponding source checkout class: their
arguments are described on the following pages.
