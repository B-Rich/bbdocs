<h4 class="subsection">3.1.4 Attributes of Changes</h4>

<h3 class="heading">Who</h3>

<p>Each Change has a <code>who</code> attribute, which specifies which developer is
responsible for the change. This is a string which comes from a namespace
controlled by the VC repository. Frequently this means it is a username on the
host which runs the repository, but not all VC systems require this.  Each
StatusNotifier will map the <code>who</code> attribute into something appropriate for
their particular means of communication: an email address, an IRC handle, etc.

<h3 class="heading">Files</h3>

<p>It also has a list of <code>files</code>, which are just the tree-relative
filenames of any files that were added, deleted, or modified for this
Change. These filenames are used by the <code>fileIsImportant</code>
function (in the Scheduler) to decide whether it is worth triggering a
new build or not, e.g. the function could use the following function
to only run a build if a C file were checked in:

<pre class="example">     def has_C_files(change):
         for name in change.files:
             if name.endswith(".c"):
                 return True
         return False
</pre>
   <p>Certain BuildSteps can also use the list of changed files
to run a more targeted series of tests, e.g. the
<code>python_twisted.Trial</code> step can run just the unit tests that
provide coverage for the modified .py files instead of running the
full test suite.

<h3 class="heading">Comments</h3>

<p>The Change also has a <code>comments</code> attribute, which is a string
containing any checkin comments.

<h3 class="heading">Project</h3>

<p>A change's <i>project</i>, by default the empty string, describes the source code
that changed.  It is a free-form string which the buildbot administrator can
use to flexibly discriminate among changes.

   <p>Generally, a project is an independently-buildable unit of source.  This field
can be used to apply different build steps to different projects.  For example,
an open-source application might build its Windows client from a separate
codebase than its POSIX server.  In this case, the change sources should be
configured to attach an appropriate project string (say, "win-client" and
"server") to changes from each codebase.  Schedulers would then examine these
strings and trigger the appropriate builders for each project.

<h3 class="heading">Repository</h3>

<p>A change occurs within the context of a specific repository.  This is generally
specified with a string, and for most version-control systems, this string
takes the form of a URL.

   <p>Changes can be filtered on repository, but more often this field is used as a
hint for the build steps to figure out which code to check out.

<h3 class="heading">Revision</h3>

<p>Each Change can have a <code>revision</code> attribute, which describes how
to get a tree with a specific state: a tree which includes this Change
(and all that came before it) but none that come after it. If this
information is unavailable, the <code>.revision</code> attribute will be
<code>None</code>. These revisions are provided by the ChangeSource, and
consumed by the <code>computeSourceRevision</code> method in the appropriate
<code>source.Source</code> class.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CVS</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><code>revision</code> is an int, seconds since the epoch
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SVN</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><code>revision</code> is an int, the changeset number (r%d)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Darcs</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><code>revision</code> is a large string, the output of <code>darcs changes --context</code>
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mercurial</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><code>revision</code> is a short string (a hash ID), the output of <code>hg identify</code>
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P4</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><code>revision</code> is an int, the transaction number
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Git</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><code>revision</code> is a short string (a SHA1 hash), the output of e.g. 
<code>git rev-parse</code>
</dl>

<h3 class="heading">Branches</h3>

<p>The Change might also have a <code>branch</code> attribute. This indicates
that all of the Change's files are in the same named branch. The
Schedulers get to decide whether the branch should be built or not.

   <p>For VC systems like CVS, and Git, the <code>branch</code>
name is unrelated to the filename. (that is, the branch name and the
filename inhabit unrelated namespaces). For SVN, branches are
expressed as subdirectories of the repository, so the file's
&ldquo;svnurl&rdquo; is a combination of some base URL, the branch name, and the
filename within the branch. (In a sense, the branch name and the
filename inhabit the same namespace). Darcs branches are
subdirectories of a base URL just like SVN. Mercurial branches are the
same as Darcs.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CVS</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>branch='warner-newfeature', files=['src/foo.c']
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SVN</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>branch='branches/warner-newfeature', files=['src/foo.c']
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Darcs</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>branch='warner-newfeature', files=['src/foo.c']
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mercurial</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>branch='warner-newfeature', files=['src/foo.c']
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Git</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>branch='warner-newfeature', files=['src/foo.c']
</dl>

<h3 class="heading">Build Properties</h3>

<p>A Change may have one or more properties attached to it, usually specified
through the Force Build form or see <a href="sendchange.html#sendchange">sendchange</a>. Properties are discussed
in detail in the see <a href="Build-Properties.html#Build-Properties">Build Properties</a> section.

<h3 class="heading">Links</h3>

<!-- TODO: who is using 'links'? how is it being used? -->
<p>Finally, the Change might have a <code>links</code> list, which is intended
to provide a list of URLs to a <em>viewcvs</em>-style web page that
provides more detail for this Change, perhaps including the full file
diffs.
