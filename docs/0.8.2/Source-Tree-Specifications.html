<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 Source Tree Specifications</h4>

<p>So for the Buildbot's purposes we treat each VC system as a server
which can take a list of specifications as input and produce a source
tree as output. Some of these specifications are static: they are
attributes of the builder and do not change over time. Others are more
variable: each build will have a different value. The repository is
changed over time by a sequence of Changes, each of which represents a
single developer making changes to some set of files. These Changes
are cumulative.

   <p>For normal builds, the Buildbot wants to get well-defined source trees
that contain specific Changes, and exclude other Changes that may have
occurred after the desired ones. We assume that the Changes arrive at
the buildbot (through one of the mechanisms described in see <a href="Change-Sources.html#Change-Sources">Change Sources</a>) in the same order in which they are committed to the
repository. The Buildbot waits for the tree to become &ldquo;stable&rdquo;
before initiating a build, for two reasons. The first is that
developers frequently make multiple related commits in quick
succession, even when the VC system provides ways to make atomic
transactions involving multiple files at the same time. Running a
build in the middle of these sets of changes would use an inconsistent
set of source files, and is likely to fail (and is certain to be less
useful than a build which uses the full set of changes). The
tree-stable-timer is intended to avoid these useless builds that
include some of the developer's changes but not all. The second reason
is that some VC systems (i.e. CVS) do not provide repository-wide
transaction numbers, so that timestamps are the only way to refer to
a specific repository state. These timestamps may be somewhat
ambiguous, due to processing and notification delays. By waiting until
the tree has been stable for, say, 10 minutes, we can choose a
timestamp from the middle of that period to use for our source
checkout, and then be reasonably sure that any clock-skew errors will
not cause the build to be performed on an inconsistent set of source
files.

   <p>The Schedulers always use the tree-stable-timer, with a timeout that
is configured to reflect a reasonable tradeoff between build latency
and change frequency. When the VC system provides coherent
repository-wide revision markers (such as Subversion's revision
numbers, or in fact anything other than CVS's timestamps), the
resulting Build is simply performed against a source tree defined by
that revision marker. When the VC system does not provide this, a
timestamp from the middle of the tree-stable period is used to
generate the source tree<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

to half the tree-stable timer, but it can be overridden with an
