<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 Generalizing VC Systems</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the Buildbot, we will try to generalize all VC
systems as having repositories that each provide sources for a variety
of projects. Each project is defined as a directory tree with source
files. The individual files may each have revisions, but we ignore
that and treat the project as a whole as having a set of revisions
(CVS is really the only VC system still in widespread use that has
per-file revisions.. everything modern has moved to atomic tree-wide
changesets). Each time someone commits a change to the project, a new
revision becomes available. These revisions can be described by a
tuple with two items: the first is a branch tag, and the second is
some kind of revision stamp or timestamp. Complex projects may have
multiple branch tags, but there is always a default branch. The
timestamp may be an actual timestamp (such as the -D option to CVS),
or it may be a monotonically-increasing transaction number (such as
the change number used by SVN and P4, or the revision number used by
Bazaar, or a labeled tag used in CVS)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The SHA1 revision ID used by Mercurial and Git is
also a kind of revision stamp, in that it specifies a unique copy of
the source tree, as does a Darcs &ldquo;context&rdquo; file.

   <p>When we aren't intending to make any changes to the sources we check out
(at least not any that need to be committed back upstream), there are two
basic ways to use a VC system:

     <ul>
<li>Retrieve a specific set of source revisions: some tag or key is used
to index this set, which is fixed and cannot be changed by subsequent
developers committing new changes to the tree. Releases are built from
tagged revisions like this, so that they can be rebuilt again later
(probably with controlled modifications). 
<li>Retrieve the latest sources along a specific branch: some tag is used
to indicate which branch is to be used, but within that constraint we want
to get the latest revisions. 
</ul>

   <p>Build personnel or CM staff typically use the first approach: the
build that results is (ideally) completely specified by the two
parameters given to the VC system: repository and revision tag. This
gives QA and end-users something concrete to point at when reporting
bugs. Release engineers are also reportedly fond of shipping code that
can be traced back to a concise revision tag of some sort.

   <p>Developers are more likely to use the second approach: each morning
the developer does an update to pull in the changes committed by the
team over the last day. These builds are not easy to fully specify: it
depends upon exactly when you did a checkout, and upon what local
changes the developer has in their tree. Developers do not normally
tag each build they produce, because there is usually significant
overhead involved in creating these tags. Recreating the trees used by
one of these builds can be a challenge. Some VC systems may provide
implicit tags (like a revision number), while others may allow the use
of timestamps to mean &ldquo;the state of the tree at time X&rdquo; as opposed
to a tree-state that has been explicitly marked.

   <p>The Buildbot is designed to help developers, so it usually works in
terms of <em>the latest</em> sources as opposed to specific tagged
revisions. However, it would really prefer to build from reproducible
source trees, so implicit revisions are used whenever possible.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> many VC
systems provide more complexity than this: in particular the local
views that P4 and ClearCase can assemble out of various source
directories are more complex than we're prepared to take advantage of
here</p>
