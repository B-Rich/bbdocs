<h5 class="subsubsection">4.12.2.3 Common Build Properties</h5>

<p>The following build properties are set when the build is started, and
are available to all steps.

     <dl>
<dt><code>branch</code><dd>
This comes from the build's SourceStamp, and describes which branch is
being checked out. This will be <code>None</code> (which interpolates into
<code>WithProperties</code> as an empty string) if the build is on the
default branch, which is generally the trunk. Otherwise it will be a
string like &ldquo;branches/beta1.4&rdquo;. The exact syntax depends upon the VC
system being used.

     <br><dt><code>revision</code><dd>
This also comes from the SourceStamp, and is the revision of the source code
tree that was requested from the VC system. When a build is requested of a
specific revision (as is generally the case when the build is triggered by
Changes), this will contain the revision specification. This is always a
string, although the syntax depends upon the VC system in use: for SVN it is an
integer, for Mercurial it is a short string, for Darcs it is a rather large
string, etc.

     <p>If the &ldquo;force build&rdquo; button was pressed, the revision will be <code>None</code>,
which means to use the most recent revision available.  This is a &ldquo;trunk
build&rdquo;. This will be interpolated as an empty string.

     <br><dt><code>got_revision</code><dd>
This is set when a Source step checks out the source tree, and
provides the revision that was actually obtained from the VC system. 
In general this should be the same as <code>revision</code>, except for
trunk builds, where <code>got_revision</code> indicates what revision was
current when the checkout was performed. This can be used to rebuild
the same source code later.

     <p>Note that for some VC systems (Darcs in particular), the revision is a
large string containing newlines, and is not suitable for interpolation
into a filename.

     <br><dt><code>buildername</code><dd>
This is a string that indicates which Builder the build was a part of. 
The combination of buildername and buildnumber uniquely identify a
build.

     <br><dt><code>buildnumber</code><dd>
Each build gets a number, scoped to the Builder (so the first build
performed on any given Builder will have a build number of 0). This
integer property contains the build's number.

     <br><dt><code>slavename</code><dd>
This is a string which identifies which buildslave the build is
running on.

     <br><dt><code>scheduler</code><dd>
If the build was started from a scheduler, then this property will
contain the name of that scheduler.

     <br><dt><code>repository</code><dd>
The repository of the sourcestamp for this build

     <br><dt><code>project</code><dd>
The project of the sourcestamp for this build

     <br><dt><code>workdir</code><dd>
The absolute path of the base working directory on the slave, of the current
builder.
