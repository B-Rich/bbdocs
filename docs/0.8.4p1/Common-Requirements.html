<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Common Requirements</h4>

<p>At a bare minimum, you'll need the following for both the buildmaster and a
buildslave:

     <ul>
<li>Python: http://www.python.org

     <p>Buildbot requires python-2.4 or later.

     <li>Twisted: http://twistedmatrix.com

     <p>Both the buildmaster and the buildslaves require Twisted-8.0.x or
later. As always, the most recent version is recommended.

     <p>Twisted is delivered as a collection of subpackages. You'll need at
least "Twisted" (the core package), and you'll also want TwistedMail,
TwistedWeb, and TwistedWords (for sending email, serving a web status
page, and delivering build status via IRC, respectively). You might
also want TwistedConch (for the encrypted Manhole debug port). Note
that Twisted requires ZopeInterface to be installed as well.

   </ul>

   <p>Of course, your project's build process will impose additional
requirements on the buildslaves. These hosts must have all the tools
necessary to compile and test your project's source code.

<h3 class="heading">Windows Support</h3>

<p>Buildbot - both master and slave - runs well natively on Windows.  The slave
runs well on Cygwin, but because of problems with SQLite on Cygwin, the master
does not.

   <p>Buildbot's windows testing is limited to the most recent Twisted and Python
versions.  For best results, use the most recent available versions of these
libraries on Windows.

   <p>Note that versions of MSys Git earlier than 1.7.3.1 are known to have problems
with incorrect exit statuses from git commands.  Always use the newest version
of MSys Git.
