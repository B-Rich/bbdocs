<h4 class="subsection">4.14.1 WebStatus</h4>

<p><a name="index-WebStatus-140"></a><a name="index-buildbot_002estatus_002eweb_002ebaseweb_002eWebStatus-141"></a>
The <code>buildbot.status.html.WebStatus</code> status target runs a small
web server inside the buildmaster. You can point a browser at this web
server and retrieve information about every build the buildbot knows
about, as well as find out what the buildbot is currently working on.

   <p>The first page you will see is the &ldquo;Welcome Page&rdquo;, which contains
links to all the other useful pages. By default, this page is served from
the <samp><span class="file">status/web/templates/root.html</span></samp> file in buildbot's library area. 
If you'd like to override this page or the other templates found there,
copy the files you're interested in into a <samp><span class="file">templates/</span></samp> directory in
the buildmaster's base directory.

   <p>One of the most complex resource provided by <code>WebStatus</code> is the
&ldquo;Waterfall Display&rdquo;, which shows a time-based chart of events. This
somewhat-busy display provides detailed information about all steps of all
recent builds, and provides hyperlinks to look at individual build logs and
source changes. By simply reloading this page on a regular basis, you will see
a complete description of everything the buildbot is currently working on.

   <p>A similar, but more developer-oriented display is the "Grid" display.  This
arranges builds by SourceStamp (horizontal axis) and builder (vertical axis),
and can provide quick information as to which revisions are passing or failing
on which builders.

   <p>There are also pages with more specialized information. For example,
there is a page which shows the last 20 builds performed by the
buildbot, one line each. Each line is a link to detailed information
about that build. By adding query arguments to the URL used to reach
this page, you can narrow the display to builds that involved certain
branches, or which ran on certain Builders. These pages are described
in great detail below.

<h3 class="heading">Configuration</h3>

<p>Buildbot now uses a templating system for the web interface. The source
of these templates can be found in the <samp><span class="file">status/web/templates/</span></samp> directory
in buildbot's library area. You can override these templates by creating
alternate versions in a <samp><span class="file">templates/</span></samp> directory within the buildmaster's
base directory.

   <p>The first time a buildmaster is created, the <samp><span class="file">public_html/</span></samp>
directory is populated with some sample files, which you will probably
want to customize for your own project. These files are all static:
the buildbot does not modify them in any way as it serves them to HTTP
clients.

   <p>Note that templates in <samp><span class="file">templates/</span></samp> take precedence over static files in
<samp><span class="file">public_html/</span></samp>.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.status.html import WebStatus
     c['status'].append(WebStatus(8080))
</pre>
   <p>Note that the initial robots.txt file has Disallow lines for all of
the dynamically-generated buildbot pages, to discourage web spiders
and search engines from consuming a lot of CPU time as they crawl
through the entire history of your buildbot. If you are running the
buildbot behind a reverse proxy, you'll probably need to put the
robots.txt file somewhere else (at the top level of the parent web
server), and replace the URL prefixes in it with more suitable values.

   <p>If you would like to use an alternative root directory, add the
<code>public_html=..</code> option to the <code>WebStatus</code> creation:

<pre class="example">     c['status'].append(WebStatus(8080, public_html="/var/www/buildbot"))
</pre>
   <p>In addition, if you are familiar with twisted.web <em>Resource
Trees</em>, you can write code to add additional pages at places inside
this web space. Just use <code>webstatus.putChild</code> to place these
resources.

   <p>The following section describes the special URLs and the status views
they provide.
