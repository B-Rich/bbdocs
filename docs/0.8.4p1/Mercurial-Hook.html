<h5 class="subsubsection">4.7.4.1 Mercurial Hook</h5>

<p>Since Mercurial is written in python, the hook script can invoke
Buildbot's <code>sendchange</code> function directly, rather than having to
spawn an external process. This function delivers the same sort of
changes as <code>buildbot sendchange</code> and the various hook scripts in
<code>contrib/</code>, so you'll need to add a <code>pb.PBChangeSource</code> to your
buildmaster to receive these changes.

   <p>To set this up, first choose a Mercurial repository that represents
your central &ldquo;official&rdquo; source tree. This will be the same
repository that your buildslaves will eventually pull from. Install
Buildbot on the machine that hosts this repository, using the same
version of python as Mercurial is using (so that the Mercurial hook
can import code from buildbot). Then add the following to the
<code>.hg/hgrc</code> file in that repository, replacing the buildmaster
hostname/portnumber as appropriate for your buildbot:

<pre class="example">     [hooks]
     changegroup.buildbot = python:buildbot.changes.hgbuildbot.hook
     
     [hgbuildbot]
     master = buildmaster.example.org:9987
</pre>
   <p>(Note that Mercurial lets you define multiple <code>changegroup</code> hooks
by giving them distinct names, like <code>changegroup.foo</code> and
<code>changegroup.bar</code>, which is why we use
<code>changegroup.buildbot</code> in this example. There is nothing magical
about the &ldquo;buildbot&rdquo; suffix in the hook name. The
<code>[hgbuildbot]</code> section <em>is</em> special, however, as it is the
only section that the buildbot hook pays attention to.)

   <p>Also note that this runs as a <code>changegroup</code> hook, rather than as
an <code>incoming</code> hook. The <code>changegroup</code> hook is run with
multiple revisions at a time (say, if multiple revisions are being
pushed to this repository in a single <samp><span class="command">hg push</span></samp> command),
whereas the <code>incoming</code> hook is run with just one revision at a
time. The <code>hgbuildbot.hook</code> function will only work with the
<code>changegroup</code> hook.

   <p>If the buildmaster <code>PBChangeSource</code> is configured to require
sendchange credentials then you can set these with the <code>auth</code>
parameter. When this parameter is not set it defaults to
<code>change:changepw</code>, which are the defaults for the <code>user</code> and
<code>password</code> values of a <code>PBChangeSource</code> which doesn't require
authentication.

<pre class="example">     [hgbuildbot]
     master = buildmaster.example.org:9987
     auth = clientname:supersecret
</pre>
   <p>You can set this parameter in either the global <samp><span class="file">/etc/mercurial/hgrc</span></samp>,
your personal <samp><span class="file">~/.hgrc</span></samp> file or the repository local <samp><span class="file">.hg/hgrc</span></samp>
file. But since this value is stored in plain text, you must make sure that
it can only be read by those users that need to know the authentication
credentials.

   <p>The <code>[hgbuildbot]</code> section has two other parameters that you
might specify, both of which control the name of the branch that is
attached to the changes coming from this hook.

   <p>One common branch naming policy for Mercurial repositories is to use
it just like Darcs: each branch goes into a separate repository, and
all the branches for a single project share a common parent directory. 
For example, you might have <samp><span class="file">/var/repos/PROJECT/trunk/</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/var/repos/PROJECT/release</span></samp>. To use this style, use the
<code>branchtype = dirname</code> setting, which simply uses the last
component of the repository's enclosing directory as the branch name:

<pre class="example">     [hgbuildbot]
     master = buildmaster.example.org:9987
     branchtype = dirname
</pre>
   <p>Another approach is to use Mercurial's built-in branches (the kind
created with <samp><span class="command">hg branch</span></samp> and listed with <samp><span class="command">hg
branches</span></samp>). This feature associates persistent names with particular
lines of descent within a single repository. (note that the buildbot
<code>source.Mercurial</code> checkout step does not yet support this kind
of branch). To have the commit hook deliver this sort of branch name
with the Change object, use <code>branchtype = inrepo</code>:

<pre class="example">     [hgbuildbot]
     master = buildmaster.example.org:9987
     branchtype = inrepo
</pre>
   <p>Finally, if you want to simply specify the branchname directly, for
all changes, use <code>branch = BRANCHNAME</code>. This overrides
<code>branchtype</code>:

<pre class="example">     [hgbuildbot]
     master = buildmaster.example.org:9987
     branch = trunk
</pre>
   <p>If you use <code>branch=</code> like this, you'll need to put a separate
.hgrc in each repository. If you use <code>branchtype=</code>, you may be
able to use the same .hgrc for all your repositories, stored in
<samp><span class="file">~/.hgrc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">/etc/mercurial/hgrc</span></samp>.

   <p>As twisted needs to hook some Signals, and that some web server are
strictly forbiding that, the parameter <code>fork</code> in the
<code>[hgbuildbot]</code> section will instruct mercurial to fork before
sending the change request. Then as the created process will be of short
life, it is considered as safe to disable the signal restriction in
the Apache setting like that <code>WSGIRestrictSignal Off</code>. Refer to the
documentation of your web server for other way to do the same.

   <p>The <code>category</code> parameter sets the category for any changes generated from
the hook.  Likewise, the <code>project</code> parameter sets the project.  Changes'
<code>repository</code> attributes are formed from the Mercurial repo path by
stripping <code>strip</code> slashes.
