<h3 class="section">3.8 Build Properties</h3>

<p><a name="index-Properties-17"></a>
Each build has a set of &ldquo;Build Properties&rdquo;, which can be used by its
BuildSteps to modify their actions.  These properties, in the form of
key-value pairs, provide a general framework for dynamically altering
the behavior of a build based on its circumstances.

   <p>Properties come from a number of places:
     <ul>
<li>global configuration &ndash;
These properties apply to all builds. 
<li>schedulers &ndash;
A scheduler can specify properties available to all the builds it
starts. 
<li>changes &ndash;
A change can have properties attached to it. These are usually specified
through a change source (see <a href="Change-Sources.html#Change-Sources">Change Sources</a>), the "Force Build" form on the web interface (see <a href="WebStatus.html#WebStatus">WebStatus</a>), or sendchange (see <a href="sendchange.html#sendchange">sendchange</a>). 
<li>buildslaves &ndash;
A buildslave can pass properties on to the builds it performs. 
<li>builds &ndash;
A build automatically sets a number of properties on itself. 
<li>builders &ndash;
A builder can set properties on all the builds it runs. 
<li>steps &ndash;
The steps of a build can set properties that are available to subsequent
steps.  In particular, source steps set a number of properties. 
</ul>

   <p>Properties are very flexible, and can be used to implement all manner
of functionality.  Here are some examples:

   <p>Most Source steps record the revision that they checked out in
the <code>got_revision</code> property.  A later step could use this
property to specify the name of a fully-built tarball, dropped in an
easily-acessible directory for later testing.

   <p>Some projects want to perform nightly builds as well as bulding in response to
committed changes.  Such a project would run two schedulers, both pointing to
the same set of builders, but could provide an <code>is_nightly</code> property so
that steps can distinguish the nightly builds, perhaps to run more
resource-intensive tests.

   <p>Some projects have different build processes on different systems. 
Rather than create a build factory for each slave, the steps can use
buildslave properties to identify the unique aspects of each slave
and adapt the build process dynamically.
