<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.2.3 try</h5>

<p>This lets a developer to ask the question &ldquo;What would happen if I
committed this patch right now?&rdquo;. It runs the unit test suite (across
multiple build platforms) on the developer's current code, allowing
them to make sure they will not break the tree when they finally
commit their changes.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">buildbot try</span></samp> command is meant to be run from within a
developer's local tree, and starts by figuring out the base revision
of that tree (what revision was current the last time the tree was
updated), and a patch that can be applied to that revision of the tree
to make it match the developer's copy. This (revision, patch) pair is
then sent to the buildmaster, which runs a build with that
SourceStamp. If you want, the tool will emit status messages as the
builds run, and will not terminate until the first failure has been
detected (or the last success).

   <p>There is an alternate form which accepts a pre-made patch file
(typically the output of a command like 'svn diff'). This &ldquo;&ndash;diff&rdquo;
form does not require a local tree to run from. See See <a href="try.html#try">try</a>, concerning
the &ldquo;&ndash;diff&rdquo; command option.

   <p>For this command to work, several pieces must be in place: the See <a href="Try-Schedulers.html#Try-Schedulers">Try Schedulers</a>, as well as some client-side configuration.

<h3 class="heading">locating the master</h3>

<p>The <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command needs to be told how to connect to the
try scheduler, and must know which of the authentication
approaches described above is in use by the buildmaster. You specify
the approach by using <samp><span class="option">--connect=ssh</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--connect=pb</span></samp>
(or <code>try_connect = 'ssh'</code> or <code>try_connect = 'pb'</code> in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>).

   <p>For the PB approach, the command must be given a <samp><span class="option">--master</span></samp>
argument (in the form HOST:PORT) that points to TCP port that you picked
in the <code>Try_Userpass</code> scheduler. It also takes a
<samp><span class="option">--username</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--passwd</span></samp> pair of arguments that match
one of the entries in the buildmaster's <code>userpass</code> list. These
arguments can also be provided as <code>try_master</code>,
<code>try_username</code>, and <code>try_password</code> entries in the
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file.

   <p>For the SSH approach, the command must be given <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">--username</span></samp> to get to the buildmaster host. It must also be
given <samp><span class="option">--jobdir</span></samp>, which points to the inlet directory configured
above. The jobdir can be relative to the user's home directory, but most
of the time you will use an explicit path like
<samp><span class="file">~buildbot/project/jobdir</span></samp>. These arguments can be provided in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> as <code>try_host</code>, <code>try_username</code>, and
<code>try_jobdir</code>.

   <p>In addition, the SSH approach needs to connect to a PBListener status
port, so it can retrieve and report the results of the build (the PB
approach uses the existing connection to retrieve status information,
so this step is not necessary). This requires a <samp><span class="option">--masterstatus</span></samp>
argument, or a <code>try_masterstatus</code> entry in <samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>,
in the form of a HOSTNAME:PORT string.

   <p>The following command line arguments are deprecated, but retained for
backward compatibility:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="option">--tryhost</span></samp> is replaced by <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="option">--trydir</span></samp> is replaced by <samp><span class="option">--jobdir</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="option">--master</span></samp> is replaced by <samp><span class="option">--masterstatus</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>Likewise, the following <samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file entries are
deprecated, but retained for backward compatibility:

     <ul>
<li><code>try_dir</code> is replaced by <code>try_jobdir</code>
<li><code>masterstatus</code> is replaced by <code>try_masterstatus</code>
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">choosing the Builders</h3>

<p>A trial build is performed on multiple Builders at the same time, and
the developer gets to choose which Builders are used (limited to a set
selected by the buildmaster admin with the TryScheduler's
<code>builderNames=</code> argument). The set you choose will depend upon
what your goals are: if you are concerned about cross-platform
compatibility, you should use multiple Builders, one from each
platform of interest. You might use just one builder if that platform
has libraries or other facilities that allow better test coverage than
what you can accomplish on your own machine, or faster test runs.

   <p>The set of Builders to use can be specified with multiple
<samp><span class="option">--builder</span></samp> arguments on the command line. It can also be
specified with a single <code>try_builders</code> option in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> that uses a list of strings to specify all
the Builder names:

<pre class="example">     try_builders = ["full-OSX", "full-win32", "full-linux"]
</pre>
   <p>If you are using the PB approach, you can get the names of the builders
that are configured for the try scheduler using the <code>get-builder-names</code>
argument:

<pre class="example">     buildbot try --get-builder-names --connect=pb --master=... --username=... --passwd=...
</pre>
   <h3 class="heading">specifying the VC system</h3>

<p>The <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command also needs to know how to take the
developer's current tree and extract the (revision, patch)
source-stamp pair. Each VC system uses a different process, so you
start by telling the <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command which VC system you are
using, with an argument like <samp><span class="option">--vc=cvs</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--vc=git</span></samp>. 
This can also be provided as <code>try_vc</code> in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>.

   <p>The following names are recognized: <code>bzr</code> <code>cvs</code>
<code>darcs</code> <code>git</code> <code>hg</code> <code>mtn</code> <code>p4</code> <code>svn</code>

<h3 class="heading">finding the top of the tree</h3>

<p>Some VC systems (notably CVS and SVN) track each directory
more-or-less independently, which means the <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command
needs to move up to the top of the project tree before it will be able
to construct a proper full-tree patch. To accomplish this, the
<samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command will crawl up through the parent directories
until it finds a marker file. The default name for this marker file is
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot-top</span></samp>, so when you are using CVS or SVN you should
<code>touch .buildbot-top</code> from the top of your tree before running
<samp><span class="command">buildbot try</span></samp>. Alternatively, you can use a filename like
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp>, since many projects put one of
these files in their top-most directory (and nowhere else). To set
this filename, use <samp><span class="option">--topfile=ChangeLog</span></samp>, or set it in the
options file with <code>try_topfile = 'ChangeLog'</code>.

   <p>You can also manually set the top of the tree with
<samp><span class="option">--topdir=~/trees/mytree</span></samp>, or <code>try_topdir =
'~/trees/mytree'</code>. If you use <code>try_topdir</code>, in a
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file, you will need a separate options file
for each tree you use, so it may be more convenient to use the
<code>try_topfile</code> approach instead.

   <p>Other VC systems which work on full projects instead of individual
directories (darcs, mercurial, git, monotone) do not require
<samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> to know the top directory, so the <samp><span class="option">--topfile</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">--topdir</span></samp> arguments will be ignored.

   <p>If the <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command cannot find the top directory, it will
abort with an error message.

   <p>The following command line arguments are deprecated, but retained for
backward compatibility:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="option">--try-topdir</span></samp> is replaced by <samp><span class="option">--topdir</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="option">--try-topfile</span></samp> is replaced by <samp><span class="option">--topfile</span></samp>
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">determining the branch name</h3>

<p>Some VC systems record the branch information in a way that &ldquo;try&rdquo;
can locate it.  For the others, if you are using something other than
the default branch, you will have to tell the buildbot which branch
your tree is using. You can do this with either the <samp><span class="option">--branch</span></samp>
argument, or a <samp><span class="option">try_branch</span></samp> entry in the
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file.

<h3 class="heading">determining the revision and patch</h3>

<p>Each VC system has a separate approach for determining the tree's base
revision and computing a patch.

     <dl>
    <dt><code>CVS</code><dd>
<samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> pretends that the tree is up to date. It converts the
current time into a <code>-D</code> time specification, uses it as the base
revision, and computes the diff between the upstream tree as of that
point in time versus the current contents. This works, more or less,
but requires that the local clock be in reasonably good sync with the
repository.

     <br><dt><code>SVN</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>svn status -u</code> to find the latest
repository revision number (emitted on the last line in the &ldquo;Status
against revision: NN&rdquo; message). It then performs an <code>svn diff
-rNN</code> to find out how your tree differs from the repository version,
and sends the resulting patch to the buildmaster. If your tree is not
up to date, this will result in the &ldquo;try&rdquo; tree being created with
the latest revision, then <em>backwards</em> patches applied to bring it
&ldquo;back&rdquo; to the version you actually checked out (plus your actual
code changes), but this will still result in the correct tree being
used for the build.

     <br><dt><code>bzr</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>bzr revision-info</code> to find the base revision,
then a <code>bzr diff -r$base..</code> to obtain the patch.

     <br><dt><code>Mercurial</code><dd><code>hg identify --debug</code> emits the full revision id (as opposed to
the common 12-char truncated) which is a SHA1 hash of the current
revision's contents. This is used as the base revision. 
<code>hg diff</code> then provides the patch relative to that
revision. For <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> to work, your working directory must only
have patches that are available from the same remotely-available
repository that the build process' <code>source.Mercurial</code> will use.

     <br><dt><code>Perforce</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>p4 changes -m1 ...</code> to determine the latest
changelist and implicitly assumes that the local tree is synched to this
revision. This is followed by a <code>p4 diff -du</code> to obtain the patch. 
A p4 patch differs sligtly from a normal diff. It contains full depot
paths and must be converted to paths relative to the branch top. To convert
the following restriction is imposed. The p4base (see see <a href="P4Source.html#P4Source">P4Source</a>)
 is assumed to be <code>//depot</code>

     <br><dt><code>Darcs</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>darcs changes --context</code> to find the list
of all patches back to and including the last tag that was made. This text
file (plus the location of a repository that contains all these
patches) is sufficient to re-create the tree. Therefore the contents
of this &ldquo;context&rdquo; file <em>are</em> the revision stamp for a
Darcs-controlled source tree.  It then does a <code>darcs diff
-u</code> to compute the patch relative to that revision.

     <br><dt><code>Git</code><dd><code>git branch -v</code> lists all the branches available in the local
repository along with the revision ID it points to and a short summary
of the last commit. The line containing the currently checked out
branch begins with '* ' (star and space) while all the others start
with '  ' (two spaces). <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> scans for this line and extracts
the branch name and revision from it. Then it generates a diff against
the base revision. 
<!-- TODO: I'm not sure if this actually works the way it's intended -->
<!-- since the extracted base revision might not actually exist in the -->
<!-- upstream repository. Perhaps we need to add a -remote option to -->
<!-- specify the remote tracking branch to generate a diff against. -->

     <br><dt><code>Monotone</code><dd><code>mtn automate get_base_revision_id</code> emits the full revision id
which is a SHA1 hash of the current revision's contents. This is used as
the base revision. 
<code>mtn diff</code> then provides the patch relative to that revision.  For
<samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> to work, your working directory must only have patches
that are available from the same remotely-available repository that the
build process' <code>source.Monotone</code> will use.

   </dl>

<h3 class="heading">showing who built</h3>

<p>You can provide the <samp><span class="option">--who=dev</span></samp> to designate who is running the
try build. This will add the <code>dev</code> to the Reason field on the try
build's status web page. You can also set <code>try_who = dev</code> in the
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file. Note that <samp><span class="option">--who=dev</span></samp> will not
work on version 0.8.3 or earlier masters.

<h3 class="heading">waiting for results</h3>

<p>If you provide the <samp><span class="option">--wait</span></samp> option (or <code>try_wait = True</code>
in <samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>), the <samp><span class="command">buildbot try</span></samp> command will
wait until your changes have either been proven good or bad before
exiting. Unless you use the <samp><span class="option">--quiet</span></samp> option (or
<code>try_quiet=True</code>), it will emit a progress message every 60
seconds until the builds have completed.

   <p>Sometimes you might have a patch from someone else that you want to
submit to the buildbot. For example, a user may have created a patch
to fix some specific bug and sent it to you by email. You've inspected
the patch and suspect that it might do the job (and have at least
confirmed that it doesn't do anything evil). Now you want to test it
out.

   <p>One approach would be to check out a new local tree, apply the patch,
run your local tests, then use &ldquo;buildbot try&rdquo; to run the tests on
other platforms. An alternate approach is to use the <samp><span class="command">buildbot
try --diff</span></samp> form to have the buildbot test the patch without using a
local tree.

   <p>This form takes a <samp><span class="option">--diff</span></samp> argument which points to a file that
contains the patch you want to apply. By default this patch will be
applied to the TRUNK revision, but if you give the optional
<samp><span class="option">--baserev</span></samp> argument, a tree of the given revision will be used
as a starting point instead of TRUNK.

   <p>You can also use <samp><span class="command">buildbot try --diff=-</span></samp> to read the patch
from stdin.

   <p>Each patch has a &ldquo;patchlevel&rdquo; associated with it. This indicates the
number of slashes (and preceding pathnames) that should be stripped
before applying the diff. This exactly corresponds to the <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">--strip</span></samp> argument to the <samp><span class="command">patch</span></samp> utility. By
default <samp><span class="command">buildbot try --diff</span></samp> uses a patchlevel of 0, but you
can override this with the <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> argument.

   <p>When you use <samp><span class="option">--diff</span></samp>, you do not need to use any of the other
options that relate to a local tree, specifically <samp><span class="option">--vc</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">--topfile</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">--topdir</span></samp>. These options will
be ignored. Of course you must still specify how to get to the
buildmaster (with <samp><span class="option">--connect</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp>, etc).
