<h3 class="section">2.6 Upgrading an Existing Buildmaster</h3>

<p>If you have just installed a new version of the Buildbot code, and you
have buildmasters that were created using an older version, you'll
need to upgrade these buildmasters before you can use them. The
upgrade process adds and modifies files in the buildmaster's base
directory to make it compatible with the new code.

<pre class="example">     buildbot upgrade-master <var>basedir</var>
</pre>
   <p>This command will also scan your <samp><span class="file">master.cfg</span></samp> file for
incompatibilities (by loading it and printing any errors or deprecation
warnings that occur). Each buildbot release tries to be compatible
with configurations that worked cleanly (i.e. without deprecation
warnings) on the previous release: any functions or classes that are
to be removed will first be deprecated in a release, to give you a
chance to start using the replacement.

   <p>The <code>upgrade-master</code> command is idempotent. It is safe to run it
multiple times. After each upgrade of the buildbot code, you should
use <code>upgrade-master</code> on all your buildmasters.

   <p>In general, Buildbot slaves and masters can be upgraded independently, although
some new features will not be available, depending on the master and slave
versions.

   <p>Beyond this general information, read all of the sections below that apply to
versions through which you are upgrading.
