<h5 class="subsubsection">4.9.3.1 Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud ("AWS EC2")</h5>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">AWS EC2</a> is a web service that allows you to
start virtual machines in an Amazon data center. Please see their website for
details, incuding costs. Using the AWS EC2 latent buildslaves involves getting
an EC2 account with AWS and setting up payment; customizing one or more EC2
machine images ("AMIs") on your desired operating system(s) and publishing
them (privately if needed); and configuring the buildbot master to know how to
start your customized images for "substantiating" your latent slaves.

<h3 class="heading">Get an AWS EC2 Account</h3>

<p>To start off, to use the AWS EC2 latent buildslave, you need to get an AWS
developer account and sign up for EC2. These instructions may help you get
started:

     <ul>
<li>Go to http://aws.amazon.com/ and click to "Sign Up Now" for an AWS account.

     <li>Once you are logged into your account, you need to sign up for EC2. 
Instructions for how to do this have changed over time because Amazon changes
their website, so the best advice is to hunt for it. After signing up for EC2,
it may say it wants you to upload an x.509 cert. You will need this to create
images (see below) but it is not technically necessary for the buildbot master
configuration.

     <li>You must enter a valid credit card before you will be able to use EC2. Do that
under 'Payment Method'.

     <li>Make sure you're signed up for EC2 by going to 'Your Account'-&gt;'Account
Activity' and verifying EC2 is listed. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Create an AMI</h3>

<p>Now you need to create an AMI and configure the master.  You may need to
run through this cycle a few times to get it working, but these instructions
should get you started.

   <p>Creating an AMI is out of the scope of this document.  The
<a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/">EC2 Getting Started Guide</a>
is a good resource for this task.  Here are a few additional hints.

     <ul>
<li>When an instance of the image starts, it needs to automatically start a
buildbot slave that connects to your master (to create a buildbot slave,
see <a href="Creating-a-buildslave.html#Creating-a-buildslave">Creating a buildslave</a>; to make a daemon,
see <a href="Launching-the-daemons.html#Launching-the-daemons">Launching the daemons</a>).

     <li>You may want to make an instance of the buildbot slave, configure it as a
standard buildslave in the master (i.e., not as a latent slave), and test and
debug it that way before you turn it into an AMI and convert to a latent
slave in the master. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Configure the Master with an EC2LatentBuildSlave</h3>

<p>Now let's assume you have an AMI that should work with the
EC2LatentBuildSlave.  It's now time to set up your buildbot master
configuration.

   <p>You will need some information from your AWS account: the "Access Key Id" and
the "Secret Access Key".  If you've built the AMI yourself, you probably
already are familiar with these values.  If you have not, and someone has
given you access to an AMI, these hints may help you find the necessary
values:

     <ul>
<li>While logged into your AWS account, find the "Access Identifiers" link (either
on the left, or via "Your Account" -&gt; "Access Identifiers".

     <li>On the page, you'll see alphanumeric values for "Your Access Key Id:" and
"Your Secret Access Key:". Make a note of these. Later on, we'll call the
first one your "identifier" and the second one your "secret_identifier." 
</ul>

   <p>When creating an EC2LatentBuildSlave in the buildbot master configuration,
the first three arguments are required.  The name and password are the first
two arguments, and work the same as with normal buildslaves.  The next
argument specifies the type of the EC2 virtual machine (available options as
of this writing include "m1.small", "m1.large", 'm1.xlarge", "c1.medium",
and "c1.xlarge"; see the EC2 documentation for descriptions of these
machines).

   <p>Here is the simplest example of configuring an EC2 latent buildslave. It
specifies all necessary remaining values explicitly in the instantiation.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.ec2buildslave import EC2LatentBuildSlave
     c['slaves'] = [EC2LatentBuildSlave('bot1', 'sekrit', 'm1.large',
                                        ami='ami-12345',
                                        identifier='publickey',
                                        secret_identifier='privatekey'
                                        )]
</pre>
   <p>The "ami" argument specifies the AMI that the master should start.  The
"identifier" argument specifies the AWS "Access Key Id," and the
"secret_identifier" specifies the AWS "Secret Access Key." Both the AMI and
the account information can be specified in alternate ways.

   <p>Note that whoever has your identifier and secret_identifier values can request
AWS work charged to your account, so these values need to be carefully
protected. Another way to specify these access keys is to put them in a
separate file. You can then make the access privileges stricter for this
separate file, and potentially let more people read your main configuration
file.

   <p>By default, you can make an .ec2 directory in the home folder of the user
running the buildbot master. In that directory, create a file called aws_id. 
The first line of that file should be your access key id; the second line
should be your secret access key id. Then you can instantiate the build slave
as follows.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.ec2buildslave import EC2LatentBuildSlave
     c['slaves'] = [EC2LatentBuildSlave('bot1', 'sekrit', 'm1.large',
                                        ami='ami-12345')]
</pre>
   <p>If you want to put the key information in another file, use the
"aws_id_file_path" initialization argument.

   <p>Previous examples used a particular AMI.  If the Buildbot master will be
deployed in a process-controlled environment, it may be convenient to
specify the AMI more flexibly.  Rather than specifying an individual AMI,
specify one or two AMI filters.

   <p>In all cases, the AMI that sorts last by its location (the S3 bucket and
manifest name) will be preferred.

   <p>One available filter is to specify the acceptable AMI owners, by AWS account
number (the 12 digit number, usually rendered in AWS with hyphens like
"1234-5678-9012", should be entered as in integer).

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.ec2buildslave import EC2LatentBuildSlave
     bot1 = EC2LatentBuildSlave('bot1', 'sekrit', 'm1.large',
                                valid_ami_owners=[11111111111,
                                                  22222222222],
                                identifier='publickey',
                                secret_identifier='privatekey'
                                )
</pre>
   <p>The other available filter is to provide a regular expression string that
will be matched against each AMI's location (the S3 bucket and manifest name).

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.ec2buildslave import EC2LatentBuildSlave
     bot1 = EC2LatentBuildSlave(
         'bot1', 'sekrit', 'm1.large',
         valid_ami_location_regex=r'buildbot\-.*/image.manifest.xml',
         identifier='publickey', secret_identifier='privatekey')
</pre>
   <p>The regular expression can specify a group, which will be preferred for the
sorting.  Only the first group is used; subsequent groups are ignored.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.ec2buildslave import EC2LatentBuildSlave
     bot1 = EC2LatentBuildSlave(
         'bot1', 'sekrit', 'm1.large',
         valid_ami_location_regex=r'buildbot\-.*\-(.*)/image.manifest.xml',
         identifier='publickey', secret_identifier='privatekey')
</pre>
   <p>If the group can be cast to an integer, it will be.  This allows 10 to sort
after 1, for instance.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.ec2buildslave import EC2LatentBuildSlave
     bot1 = EC2LatentBuildSlave(
         'bot1', 'sekrit', 'm1.large',
         valid_ami_location_regex=r'buildbot\-.*\-(\d+)/image.manifest.xml',
         identifier='publickey', secret_identifier='privatekey')
</pre>
   <p>In addition to using the password as a handshake between the master and the
slave, you may want to use a firewall to assert that only machines from a
specific IP can connect as slaves.  This is possible with AWS EC2 by using
the Elastic IP feature.  To configure, generate a Elastic IP in AWS, and then
specify it in your configuration using the "elastic_ip" argument.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.ec2buildslave import EC2LatentBuildSlave
     c['slaves'] = [EC2LatentBuildSlave('bot1', 'sekrit', 'm1.large',
                                        'ami-12345',
                                        identifier='publickey',
                                        secret_identifier='privatekey',
                                        elastic_ip='208.77.188.166'
                                        )]
</pre>
   <p>The EC2LatentBuildSlave supports all other configuration from the standard
BuildSlave.  The "missing_timeout" and "notify_on_missing" specify how long
to wait for an EC2 instance to attach before considering the attempt to have
failed, and email addresses to alert, respectively.  "missing_timeout"
defaults to 20 minutes.

   <p>The "build_wait_timeout" allows you to specify how long an EC2LatentBuildSlave
should wait after a build for another build before it shuts down the EC2
instance.  It defaults to 10 minutes.

   <p>"keypair_name" and "security_name" allow you to specify different names for
these AWS EC2 values.  They both default to "latent_buildbot_slave".
