<h4 class="subsection">5.2.3 try</h4>

<p>This lets a developer to ask the question &ldquo;What would happen if I
committed this patch right now?&rdquo;. It runs the unit test suite (across
multiple build platforms) on the developer's current code, allowing
them to make sure they will not break the tree when they finally
commit their changes.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">buildbot try</span></samp> command is meant to be run from within a
developer's local tree, and starts by figuring out the base revision
of that tree (what revision was current the last time the tree was
updated), and a patch that can be applied to that revision of the tree
to make it match the developer's copy. This (revision, patch) pair is
then sent to the buildmaster, which runs a build with that
SourceStamp. If you want, the tool will emit status messages as the
builds run, and will not terminate until the first failure has been
detected (or the last success).

   <p>There is an alternate form which accepts a pre-made patch file
(typically the output of a command like 'svn diff'). This &ldquo;&ndash;diff&rdquo;
form does not require a local tree to run from. See See <a href="try-_002d_002ddiff.html#try-_002d_002ddiff">try &ndash;diff</a>.

   <p>For this command to work, several pieces must be in place:

<h3 class="heading">TryScheduler</h3>

<p><a name="index-buildbot_002escheduler_002eTry_005fJobdir-134"></a><a name="index-buildbot_002escheduler_002eTry_005fUserpass-135"></a>
The buildmaster must have a <code>scheduler.Try</code> instance in
the config file's <code>c['schedulers']</code> list. This lets the
administrator control who may initiate these &ldquo;trial&rdquo; builds, which
branches are eligible for trial builds, and which Builders should be
used for them.

   <p>The <code>TryScheduler</code> has various means to accept build requests:
all of them enforce more security than the usual buildmaster ports do. 
Any source code being built can be used to compromise the buildslave
accounts, but in general that code must be checked out from the VC
repository first, so only people with commit privileges can get
control of the buildslaves. The usual force-build control channels can
waste buildslave time but do not allow arbitrary commands to be
executed by people who don't have those commit privileges. However,
the source code patch that is provided with the trial build does not
have to go through the VC system first, so it is important to make
sure these builds cannot be abused by a non-committer to acquire as
much control over the buildslaves as a committer has. Ideally, only
developers who have commit access to the VC repository would be able
to start trial builds, but unfortunately the buildmaster does not, in
general, have access to VC system's user list.

   <p>As a result, the <code>TryScheduler</code> requires a bit more
configuration. There are currently two ways to set this up:

     <dl>
<dt><strong>jobdir (ssh)</strong><dd>
This approach creates a command queue directory, called the
&ldquo;jobdir&rdquo;, in the buildmaster's working directory. The buildmaster
admin sets the ownership and permissions of this directory to only
grant write access to the desired set of developers, all of whom must
have accounts on the machine. The <code>buildbot try</code> command creates
a special file containing the source stamp information and drops it in
the jobdir, just like a standard maildir. When the buildmaster notices
the new file, it unpacks the information inside and starts the builds.

     <p>The config file entries used by 'buildbot try' either specify a local
queuedir (for which write and mv are used) or a remote one (using scp
and ssh).

     <p>The advantage of this scheme is that it is quite secure, the
disadvantage is that it requires fiddling outside the buildmaster
config (to set the permissions on the jobdir correctly). If the
buildmaster machine happens to also house the VC repository, then it
can be fairly easy to keep the VC userlist in sync with the
trial-build userlist. If they are on different machines, this will be
much more of a hassle. It may also involve granting developer accounts
on a machine that would not otherwise require them.

     <p>To implement this, the buildslave invokes 'ssh -l username host
buildbot tryserver ARGS', passing the patch contents over stdin. The
arguments must include the inlet directory and the revision
information.

     <br><dt><strong>user+password (PB)</strong><dd>
In this approach, each developer gets a username/password pair, which
are all listed in the buildmaster's configuration file. When the
developer runs <code>buildbot try</code>, their machine connects to the
buildmaster via PB and authenticates themselves using that username
and password, then sends a PB command to start the trial build.

     <p>The advantage of this scheme is that the entire configuration is
performed inside the buildmaster's config file. The disadvantages are
that it is less secure (while the &ldquo;cred&rdquo; authentication system does
not expose the password in plaintext over the wire, it does not offer
most of the other security properties that SSH does). In addition, the
buildmaster admin is responsible for maintaining the username/password
list, adding and deleting entries as developers come and go.

   </dl>

   <p>For example, to set up the &ldquo;jobdir&rdquo; style of trial build, using a
command queue directory of <samp><span class="file">MASTERDIR/jobdir</span></samp> (and assuming that
all your project developers were members of the <code>developers</code> unix
group), you would first create that directory (with <samp><span class="command">mkdir
MASTERDIR/jobdir MASTERDIR/jobdir/new MASTERDIR/jobdir/cur
MASTERDIR/jobdir/tmp; chgrp developers MASTERDIR/jobdir
MASTERDIR/jobdir/*; chmod g+rwx,o-rwx MASTERDIR/jobdir
MASTERDIR/jobdir/*</span></samp>), and then use the following scheduler in the
buildmaster's config file:

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.scheduler import Try_Jobdir
     s = Try_Jobdir("try1", ["full-linux", "full-netbsd", "full-OSX"],
                    jobdir="jobdir")
     c['schedulers'] = [s]
</pre>
   <p>Note that you must create the jobdir before telling the buildmaster to
use this configuration, otherwise you will get an error. Also remember
that the buildmaster must be able to read and write to the jobdir as
well. Be sure to watch the <samp><span class="file">twistd.log</span></samp> file (see <a href="Logfiles.html#Logfiles">Logfiles</a>)
as you start using the jobdir, to make sure the buildmaster is happy
with it.

   <p>To use the username/password form of authentication, create a
<code>Try_Userpass</code> instance instead. It takes the same
<code>builderNames</code> argument as the <code>Try_Jobdir</code> form, but
accepts an addtional <code>port</code> argument (to specify the TCP port to
listen on) and a <code>userpass</code> list of username/password pairs to
accept. Remember to use good passwords for this: the security of the
buildslave accounts depends upon it:

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.scheduler import Try_Userpass
     s = Try_Userpass("try2", ["full-linux", "full-netbsd", "full-OSX"],
                      port=8031, userpass=[("alice","pw1"), ("bob", "pw2")] )
     c['schedulers'] = [s]
</pre>
   <p>Like most places in the buildbot, the <code>port</code> argument takes a
strports specification. See <code>twisted.application.strports</code> for
details.

<h3 class="heading">locating the master</h3>

<p>The <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command needs to be told how to connect to the
<code>TryScheduler</code>, and must know which of the authentication
approaches described above is in use by the buildmaster. You specify
the approach by using <samp><span class="option">--connect=ssh</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--connect=pb</span></samp>
(or <code>try_connect = 'ssh'</code> or <code>try_connect = 'pb'</code> in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>).

   <p>For the PB approach, the command must be given a <samp><span class="option">--master</span></samp>
argument (in the form HOST:PORT) that points to TCP port that you
picked in the <code>Try_Userpass</code> scheduler. It also takes a
<samp><span class="option">--username</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--passwd</span></samp> pair of arguments that match
one of the entries in the buildmaster's <code>userpass</code> list. These
arguments can also be provided as <code>try_master</code>,
<code>try_username</code>, and <code>try_password</code> entries in the
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file.

   <p>For the SSH approach, the command must be given <samp><span class="option">--tryhost</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">--username</span></samp>, and optionally <samp><span class="option">--password</span></samp> (TODO:
really?) to get to the buildmaster host. It must also be given
<samp><span class="option">--trydir</span></samp>, which points to the inlet directory configured
above. The trydir can be relative to the user's home directory, but
most of the time you will use an explicit path like
<samp><span class="file">~buildbot/project/trydir</span></samp>. These arguments can be provided in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> as <code>try_host</code>, <code>try_username</code>,
<code>try_password</code>, and <code>try_dir</code>.

   <p>In addition, the SSH approach needs to connect to a PBListener status
port, so it can retrieve and report the results of the build (the PB
approach uses the existing connection to retrieve status information,
so this step is not necessary). This requires a <samp><span class="option">--master</span></samp>
argument, or a <code>masterstatus</code> entry in <samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>,
in the form of a HOSTNAME:PORT string.

<h3 class="heading">choosing the Builders</h3>

<p>A trial build is performed on multiple Builders at the same time, and
the developer gets to choose which Builders are used (limited to a set
selected by the buildmaster admin with the TryScheduler's
<code>builderNames=</code> argument). The set you choose will depend upon
what your goals are: if you are concerned about cross-platform
compatibility, you should use multiple Builders, one from each
platform of interest. You might use just one builder if that platform
has libraries or other facilities that allow better test coverage than
what you can accomplish on your own machine, or faster test runs.

   <p>The set of Builders to use can be specified with multiple
<samp><span class="option">--builder</span></samp> arguments on the command line. It can also be
specified with a single <code>try_builders</code> option in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> that uses a list of strings to specify all
the Builder names:

<pre class="example">     try_builders = ["full-OSX", "full-win32", "full-linux"]
</pre>
   <p>If you are using the PB approach, you can get the names of the builders
that are configured for the try scheduler using the <code>get-builder-names</code>
argument:

<pre class="example">     buildbot try --get-builder-names --connect=pb --master=... --username=... --passwd=...
</pre>
   <h3 class="heading">specifying the VC system</h3>

<p>The <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command also needs to know how to take the
developer's current tree and extract the (revision, patch)
source-stamp pair. Each VC system uses a different process, so you
start by telling the <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command which VC system you are
using, with an argument like <samp><span class="option">--vc=cvs</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--vc=tla</span></samp>. 
This can also be provided as <code>try_vc</code> in
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>.

<!-- The order of this list comes from the end of scripts/tryclient.py -->
   <p>The following names are recognized: <code>cvs</code> <code>svn</code> <code>baz</code>
<code>tla</code> <code>bzr</code> <code>hg</code> <code>darcs</code> <code>git</code> <code>p4</code>

<h3 class="heading">finding the top of the tree</h3>

<p>Some VC systems (notably CVS and SVN) track each directory
more-or-less independently, which means the <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command
needs to move up to the top of the project tree before it will be able
to construct a proper full-tree patch. To accomplish this, the
<samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command will crawl up through the parent directories
until it finds a marker file. The default name for this marker file is
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot-top</span></samp>, so when you are using CVS or SVN you should
<code>touch .buildbot-top</code> from the top of your tree before running
<samp><span class="command">buildbot try</span></samp>. Alternatively, you can use a filename like
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp>, since many projects put one of
these files in their top-most directory (and nowhere else). To set
this filename, use <samp><span class="option">--try-topfile=ChangeLog</span></samp>, or set it in the
options file with <code>try_topfile = 'ChangeLog'</code>.

   <p>You can also manually set the top of the tree with
<samp><span class="option">--try-topdir=~/trees/mytree</span></samp>, or <code>try_topdir =
'~/trees/mytree'</code>. If you use <code>try_topdir</code>, in a
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file, you will need a separate options file
for each tree you use, so it may be more convenient to use the
<code>try_topfile</code> approach instead.

   <p>Other VC systems which work on full projects instead of individual
directories (tla, baz, darcs, monotone, mercurial, git) do not require
<samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> to know the top directory, so the <samp><span class="option">--try-topfile</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">--try-topdir</span></samp> arguments will be ignored. 
<!-- is this true? I think I currently require topdirs all the time. -->

   <p>If the <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> command cannot find the top directory, it will
abort with an error message.

<h3 class="heading">determining the branch name</h3>

<p>Some VC systems record the branch information in a way that &ldquo;try&rdquo;
can locate it, in particular Arch (both <samp><span class="command">tla</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">baz</span></samp>). For the others, if you are using something other than
the default branch, you will have to tell the buildbot which branch
your tree is using. You can do this with either the <samp><span class="option">--branch</span></samp>
argument, or a <samp><span class="option">try_branch</span></samp> entry in the
<samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp> file.

<h3 class="heading">determining the revision and patch</h3>

<p>Each VC system has a separate approach for determining the tree's base
revision and computing a patch.

     <dl>
<dt><code>CVS</code><dd>
<samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> pretends that the tree is up to date. It converts the
current time into a <code>-D</code> time specification, uses it as the base
revision, and computes the diff between the upstream tree as of that
point in time versus the current contents. This works, more or less,
but requires that the local clock be in reasonably good sync with the
repository.

     <br><dt><code>SVN</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>svn status -u</code> to find the latest
repository revision number (emitted on the last line in the &ldquo;Status
against revision: NN&rdquo; message). It then performs an <code>svn diff
-rNN</code> to find out how your tree differs from the repository version,
and sends the resulting patch to the buildmaster. If your tree is not
up to date, this will result in the &ldquo;try&rdquo; tree being created with
the latest revision, then <em>backwards</em> patches applied to bring it
&ldquo;back&rdquo; to the version you actually checked out (plus your actual
code changes), but this will still result in the correct tree being
used for the build.

     <br><dt><code>baz</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>baz tree-id</code> to determine the
fully-qualified version and patch identifier for the tree
(ARCHIVE/VERSION&ndash;patch-NN), and uses the VERSION&ndash;patch-NN component
as the base revision. It then does a <code>baz diff</code> to obtain the
patch.

     <br><dt><code>tla</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>tla tree-version</code> to get the
fully-qualified version identifier (ARCHIVE/VERSION), then takes the
first line of <code>tla logs --reverse</code> to figure out the base
revision. Then it does <code>tla changes --diffs</code> to obtain the patch.

     <br><dt><code>bzr</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>bzr revision-info</code> to find the base revision,
then a <code>bzr diff -r$base..</code> to obtain the patch.

     <br><dt><code>Mercurial</code><dd><code>hg identify --debug</code> emits the full revision id (as opposed to
the common 12-char truncated) which is a SHA1 hash of the current
revision's contents. This is used as the base revision. 
<code>hg diff</code> then provides the patch relative to that
revision. For <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> to work, your working directory must only
have patches that are available from the same remotely-available
repository that the build process' <code>source.Mercurial</code> will use.

     <br><dt><code>Perforce</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>p4 changes -m1 ...</code> to determine the latest
changelist and implicitly assumes that the local tree is synched to this
revision. This is followed by a <code>p4 diff -du</code> to obtain the patch. 
A p4 patch differs sligtly from a normal diff. It contains full depot
paths and must be converted to paths relative to the branch top. To convert
the following restriction is imposed. The p4base (see see <a href="P4Source.html#P4Source">P4Source</a>)
 is assumed to be <code>//depot</code>

     <br><dt><code>Darcs</code><dd><samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> does a <code>darcs changes --context</code> to find the list
of all patches back to and including the last tag that was made. This text
file (plus the location of a repository that contains all these
patches) is sufficient to re-create the tree. Therefore the contents
of this &ldquo;context&rdquo; file <em>are</em> the revision stamp for a
Darcs-controlled source tree.  It then does a <code>darcs diff
-u</code> to compute the patch relative to that revision.

     <br><dt><code>Git</code><dd><code>git branch -v</code> lists all the branches available in the local
repository along with the revision ID it points to and a short summary
of the last commit. The line containing the currently checked out
branch begins with '* ' (star and space) while all the others start
with '  ' (two spaces). <samp><span class="command">try</span></samp> scans for this line and extracts
the branch name and revision from it. Then it generates a diff against
the base revision. 
<!-- TODO: I'm not sure if this actually works the way it's intended -->
<!-- since the extracted base revision might not actually exist in the -->
<!-- upstream repository. Perhaps we need to add a -remote option to -->
<!-- specify the remote tracking branch to generate a diff against. -->

     <!-- TODO: monotone -->
   </dl>

<h3 class="heading">waiting for results</h3>

<p>If you provide the <samp><span class="option">--wait</span></samp> option (or <code>try_wait = True</code>
in <samp><span class="file">.buildbot/options</span></samp>), the <samp><span class="command">buildbot try</span></samp> command will
wait until your changes have either been proven good or bad before
exiting. Unless you use the <samp><span class="option">--quiet</span></samp> option (or
<code>try_quiet=True</code>), it will emit a progress message every 60
seconds until the builds have completed.
