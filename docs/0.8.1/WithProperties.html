<p><a name="index-WithProperties-70"></a>
You can use build properties in ShellCommands by using the
<code>WithProperties</code> wrapper when setting the arguments of
the ShellCommand. This interpolates the named build properties
into the generated shell command.  Most step parameters accept
<code>WithProperties</code>.  Please file bugs for any parameters which
do not.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
     from buildbot.process.properties import WithProperties
     
     f.addStep(ShellCommand(
               command=["tar", "czf",
                        WithProperties("build-%s.tar.gz", "revision"),
                        "source"]))
</pre>
   <p>If this BuildStep were used in a tree obtained from Subversion, it
would create a tarball with a name like <samp><span class="file">build-1234.tar.gz</span></samp>.

   <p>The <code>WithProperties</code> function does <code>printf</code>-style string
interpolation, using strings obtained by calling
<code>build.getProperty(propname)</code>. Note that for every <code>%s</code> (or
<code>%d</code>, etc), you must have exactly one additional argument to
indicate which build property you want to insert.

   <p>You can also use python dictionary-style string interpolation by using
the <code>%(propname)s</code> syntax. In this form, the property name goes
in the parentheses, and WithProperties takes <em>no</em> additional
arguments:

<pre class="example">     f.addStep(ShellCommand(
               command=["tar", "czf",
                        WithProperties("build-%(revision)s.tar.gz"),
                        "source"]))
</pre>
   <p>Don't forget the extra &ldquo;s&rdquo; after the closing parenthesis! This is
the cause of many confusing errors.

   <p>The dictionary-style interpolation supports a number of more advanced
syntaxes, too.

     <dl>
<dt><code>propname:-replacement</code><dd>If <code>propname</code> exists, substitute its value; otherwise,
substitute <code>replacement</code>.  <code>replacement</code> may be empty
(<code>%(propname:-)s</code>)

     <br><dt><code>propname:+replacement</code><dd>If <code>propname</code> exists, substitute <code>replacement</code>; otherwise,
substitute an empty string.

   </dl>

   <p>Although these are similar to shell substitutions, no other
substitutions are currently supported, and <code>replacement</code> in the
above cannot contain more substitutions.

   <p>Note: like python, you can either do positional-argument interpolation
<em>or</em> keyword-argument interpolation, not both. Thus you cannot use
a string like <code>WithProperties("foo-%(revision)s-%s", "branch")</code>.

<h3 class="heading">Common Build Properties</h3>

<p>The following build properties are set when the build is started, and
are available to all steps.

     <dl>
<dt><code>branch</code><dd>
This comes from the build's SourceStamp, and describes which branch is
being checked out. This will be <code>None</code> (which interpolates into
<code>WithProperties</code> as an empty string) if the build is on the
default branch, which is generally the trunk. Otherwise it will be a
string like &ldquo;branches/beta1.4&rdquo;. The exact syntax depends upon the VC
system being used.

     <br><dt><code>revision</code><dd>
This also comes from the SourceStamp, and is the revision of the source code
tree that was requested from the VC system. When a build is requested of a
specific revision (as is generally the case when the build is triggered by
Changes), this will contain the revision specification. This is always a
string, although the syntax depends upon the VC system in use: for SVN it is an
integer, for Mercurial it is a short string, for Darcs it is a rather large
string, etc.

     <p>If the &ldquo;force build&rdquo; button was pressed, the revision will be <code>None</code>,
which means to use the most recent revision available.  This is a &ldquo;trunk
build&rdquo;. This will be interpolated as an empty string.

     <br><dt><code>got_revision</code><dd>
This is set when a Source step checks out the source tree, and
provides the revision that was actually obtained from the VC system. 
In general this should be the same as <code>revision</code>, except for
trunk builds, where <code>got_revision</code> indicates what revision was
current when the checkout was performed. This can be used to rebuild
the same source code later.

     <p>Note that for some VC systems (Darcs in particular), the revision is a
large string containing newlines, and is not suitable for interpolation
into a filename.

     <br><dt><code>buildername</code><dd>
This is a string that indicates which Builder the build was a part of. 
The combination of buildername and buildnumber uniquely identify a
build.

     <br><dt><code>buildnumber</code><dd>
Each build gets a number, scoped to the Builder (so the first build
performed on any given Builder will have a build number of 0). This
integer property contains the build's number.

     <br><dt><code>slavename</code><dd>
This is a string which identifies which buildslave the build is
running on.

     <br><dt><code>scheduler</code><dd>
If the build was started from a scheduler, then this property will
contain the name of that scheduler.

     <br><dt><code>repository</code><dd>
The repository of the sourcestamp for this build

     <br><dt><code>project</code><dd>
The project of the sourcestamp for this build

   </dl>
