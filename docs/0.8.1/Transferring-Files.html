<h4 class="subsection">4.11.6 Transferring Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-File-Transfer-107"></a><a name="index-buildbot_002esteps_002etransfer_002eFileUpload-108"></a><a name="index-buildbot_002esteps_002etransfer_002eFileDownload-109"></a><a name="index-buildbot_002esteps_002etransfer_002eDirectoryUpload-110"></a>
Most of the work involved in a build will take place on the
buildslave. But occasionally it is useful to do some work on the
buildmaster side. The most basic way to involve the buildmaster is
simply to move a file from the slave to the master, or vice versa. 
There are a pair of BuildSteps named <code>FileUpload</code> and
<code>FileDownload</code> to provide this functionality. <code>FileUpload</code>
moves a file <em>up to</em> the master, while <code>FileDownload</code> moves
a file <em>down from</em> the master.

   <p>As an example, let's assume that there is a step which produces an
HTML file within the source tree that contains some sort of generated
project documentation. We want to move this file to the buildmaster,
into a <samp><span class="file">~/public_html</span></samp> directory, so it can be visible to
developers. This file will wind up in the slave-side working directory
under the name <samp><span class="file">docs/reference.html</span></samp>. We want to put it into the
master-side <samp><span class="file">~/public_html/ref.html</span></samp>.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
     from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileUpload
     
     f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "docs"]))
     f.addStep(FileUpload(slavesrc="docs/reference.html",
                          masterdest="~/public_html/ref.html"))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>masterdest=</code> argument will be passed to os.path.expanduser,
so things like &ldquo;~&rdquo; will be expanded properly. Non-absolute paths
will be interpreted relative to the buildmaster's base directory. 
Likewise, the <code>slavesrc=</code> argument will be expanded and
interpreted relative to the builder's working directory.

   <p>To move a file from the master to the slave, use the
<code>FileDownload</code> command. For example, let's assume that some step
requires a configuration file that, for whatever reason, could not be
recorded in the source code repository or generated on the buildslave
side:

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
     from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileDownload
     
     f.addStep(FileDownload(mastersrc="~/todays_build_config.txt",
                            slavedest="build_config.txt"))
     f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "config"]))
</pre>
   <p>Like <code>FileUpload</code>, the <code>mastersrc=</code> argument is interpreted
relative to the buildmaster's base directory, and the
<code>slavedest=</code> argument is relative to the builder's working
directory. If the buildslave is running in <samp><span class="file">~buildslave</span></samp>, and the
builder's &ldquo;builddir&rdquo; is something like <samp><span class="file">tests-i386</span></samp>, then the
workdir is going to be <samp><span class="file">~buildslave/tests-i386/build</span></samp>, and a
<code>slavedest=</code> of <samp><span class="file">foo/bar.html</span></samp> will get put in
<samp><span class="file">~buildslave/tests-i386/build/foo/bar.html</span></samp>. Both of these commands
will create any missing intervening directories.

<h4 class="subheading">Other Parameters</h4>

<p>The <code>maxsize=</code> argument lets you set a maximum size for the file
to be transferred. This may help to avoid surprises: transferring a
100MB coredump when you were expecting to move a 10kB status file
might take an awfully long time. The <code>blocksize=</code> argument
controls how the file is sent over the network: larger blocksizes are
slightly more efficient but also consume more memory on each end, and
there is a hard-coded limit of about 640kB.

   <p>The <code>mode=</code> argument allows you to control the access permissions
of the target file, traditionally expressed as an octal integer. The
most common value is probably 0755, which sets the &ldquo;x&rdquo; executable
bit on the file (useful for shell scripts and the like). The default
value for <code>mode=</code> is None, which means the permission bits will
default to whatever the umask of the writing process is. The default
umask tends to be fairly restrictive, but at least on the buildslave
you can make it less restrictive with a &ndash;umask command-line option at
creation time (see <a href="Buildslave-Options.html#Buildslave-Options">Buildslave Options</a>).

<h4 class="subheading">Transfering Directories</h4>

<p>To transfer complete directories from the buildslave to the master, there
is a BuildStep named <code>DirectoryUpload</code>. It works like <code>FileUpload</code>,
just for directories. However it does not support the <code>maxsize</code>,
<code>blocksize</code> and <code>mode</code> arguments. As an example, let's assume an
generated project documentation, which consists of many files (like the output
of doxygen or epydoc). We want to move the entire documentation to the
buildmaster, into a <code>~/public_html/docs</code> directory. On the slave-side
the directory can be found under <code>docs</code>:

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
     from buildbot.steps.transfer import DirectoryUpload
     
     f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "docs"]))
     f.addStep(DirectoryUpload(slavesrc="docs",
     				masterdest="~/public_html/docs"))
</pre>
   <p>The DirectoryUpload step will create all necessary directories and
transfers empty directories, too.
