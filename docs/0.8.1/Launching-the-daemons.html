<h3 class="section">2.7 Launching the daemons</h3>

<p>Both the buildmaster and the buildslave run as daemon programs. To
launch them, pass the working directory to the <code>buildbot</code>
and <code>buildslave</code> commands, as appropriate:

<pre class="example">     # start a master
     buildbot start <var>BASEDIR</var>
     # start a slave
     buildslave start <var>SLAVE_BASEDIR</var>
</pre>
   <p>The <var>BASEDIR</var> is option and can be omitted if the current directory
contains the buildbot configuration (the <samp><span class="file">buildbot.tac</span></samp> file).

<pre class="example">     buildbot start
</pre>
   <p>This command will start the daemon and then return, so normally it
will not produce any output. To verify that the programs are indeed
running, look for a pair of files named <samp><span class="file">twistd.log</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">twistd.pid</span></samp> that should be created in the working directory. 
<samp><span class="file">twistd.pid</span></samp> contains the process ID of the newly-spawned daemon.

   <p>When the buildslave connects to the buildmaster, new directories will
start appearing in its base directory. The buildmaster tells the slave
to create a directory for each Builder which will be using that slave. 
All build operations are performed within these directories: CVS
checkouts, compiles, and tests.

   <p>Once you get everything running, you will want to arrange for the
buildbot daemons to be started at boot time. One way is to use
<code>cron</code>, by putting them in a @reboot crontab entry<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>:

<pre class="example">     @reboot buildbot start <var>BASEDIR</var>
</pre>
   <p>When you run <samp><span class="command">crontab</span></samp> to set this up, remember to do it as
the buildmaster or buildslave account! If you add this to your crontab
when running as your regular account (or worse yet, root), then the
daemon will run as the wrong user, quite possibly as one with more
authority than you intended to provide.

   <p>It is important to remember that the environment provided to cron jobs
and init scripts can be quite different that your normal runtime. 
There may be fewer environment variables specified, and the PATH may
be shorter than usual. It is a good idea to test out this method of
launching the buildslave by using a cron job with a time in the near
future, with the same command, and then check <samp><span class="file">twistd.log</span></samp> to
make sure the slave actually started correctly. Common problems here
are for <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">~/bin</span></samp> to not be on your
<code>PATH</code>, or for <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to not be set correctly. 
Sometimes <code>HOME</code> is messed up too.

   <p>Some distributions may include conveniences to make starting buildbot
at boot time easy.  For instance, with the default buildbot package in
Debian-based distributions, you may only need to modify
<code>/etc/default/buildbot</code> (see also <code>/etc/init.d/buildbot</code>, which
reads the configuration in <code>/etc/default/buildbot</code>).

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> this
@reboot syntax is understood by Vixie cron, which is the flavor
usually provided with linux systems. Other unices may have a cron that
doesn't understand @reboot</p>
