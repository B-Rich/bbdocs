<h4 class="subsection">2.5.2 Upgrading a Buildmaster to Buildbot-0.8.0</h4>

<p>Buildbot-0.8.0 introduces a database backend, which is SQLite by default.  The
<code>upgrade-master</code> command will automatically create and populate this
database with the changes the buildmaster has seen.  Note that, as of this
release, build history is <i>not</i> contained in the database, and is thus not
migrated.

   <p>The upgrade process renames the Changes pickle (<code>$basedir/changes.pck</code>) to
<code>changes.pck.old</code> once the upgrade is complete.  To reverse the upgrade,
simply downgrade Buildbot and move this file back to its original name.  You
may also wish to delete the state database (<code>state.sqlite</code>).

<h3 class="heading">Change Encoding Issues</h3>

<p>The upgrade process assumes that strings in your Changes pickle are encoded in
UTF-8 (or plain ASCII).  If this is not the case, and if there are non-UTF-8
characters in the pickle, the upgrade will fail with a suitable error message. 
If this occurs, you have two options.  If the change history is not important
to your purpose, you can simply delete <code>changes.pck</code>.

   <p>If you would like to keep the change history, then you will need to figure out
which encoding is in use, and use <code>contrib/fix_changes_pickle_encoding.py</code>
to rewrite the changes pickle into Unicode before upgrading the master.  A
typical invocation (with Mac-Roman encoding) might look like:

<pre class="example">     $ python $buildbot/contrib/fix_changes_pickle_encoding.py changes.pck macroman
     decoding bytestrings in changes.pck using macroman
     converted 11392 strings
     backing up changes.pck to changes.pck.old
</pre>
   <p>If your Changes pickle uses multiple encodings, you're on your own, but the
script in contrib may provide a good starting point for the fix.
