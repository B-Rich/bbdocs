<h3 class="section">2.6 Creating a buildslave</h3>

<p>Typically, you will be adding a buildslave to an existing buildmaster,
to provide additional architecture coverage. The buildbot
administrator will give you several pieces of information necessary to
connect to the buildmaster. You should also be somewhat familiar with
the project being tested, so you can troubleshoot build problems
locally.

   <p>The buildbot exists to make sure that the project's stated &ldquo;how to
build it&rdquo; process actually works. To this end, the buildslave should
run in an environment just like that of your regular developers. 
Typically the project build process is documented somewhere
(<samp><span class="file">README</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp>, etc), in a document that should
mention all library dependencies and contain a basic set of build
instructions. This document will be useful as you configure the host
and account in which the buildslave runs.

   <p>Here's a good checklist for setting up a buildslave:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Set up the account

     <p>It is recommended (although not mandatory) to set up a separate user
account for the buildslave. This account is frequently named
<code>buildbot</code> or <code>buildslave</code>. This serves to isolate your
personal working environment from that of the slave's, and helps to
minimize the security threat posed by letting possibly-unknown
contributors run arbitrary code on your system. The account should
have a minimum of fancy init scripts.

     <li>Install the buildbot code

     <p>Follow the instructions given earlier (see <a href="Installing-the-code.html#Installing-the-code">Installing the code</a>). 
If you use a separate buildslave account, and you didn't install the
buildbot code to a shared location, then you will need to install it
with <code>--home=~</code> for each account that needs it.

     <li>Set up the host

     <p>Make sure the host can actually reach the buildmaster. Usually the
buildmaster is running a status webserver on the same machine, so
simply point your web browser at it and see if you can get there. 
Install whatever additional packages or libraries the project's
INSTALL document advises. (or not: if your buildslave is supposed to
make sure that building without optional libraries still works, then
don't install those libraries).

     <p>Again, these libraries don't necessarily have to be installed to a
site-wide shared location, but they must be available to your build
process. Accomplishing this is usually very specific to the build
process, so installing them to <samp><span class="file">/usr</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> is
usually the best approach.

     <li>Test the build process

     <p>Follow the instructions in the INSTALL document, in the buildslave's
account. Perform a full CVS (or whatever) checkout, configure, make,
run tests, etc. Confirm that the build works without manual fussing. 
If it doesn't work when you do it by hand, it will be unlikely to work
when the buildbot attempts to do it in an automated fashion.

     <li>Choose a base directory

     <p>This should be somewhere in the buildslave's account, typically named
after the project which is being tested. The buildslave will not touch
any file outside of this directory. Something like <samp><span class="file">~/Buildbot</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="file">~/Buildslaves/fooproject</span></samp> is appropriate.

     <li>Get the buildmaster host/port, botname, and password

     <p>When the buildbot admin configures the buildmaster to accept and use
your buildslave, they will provide you with the following pieces of
information:

          <ul>
<li>your buildslave's name
<li>the password assigned to your buildslave
<li>the hostname and port number of the buildmaster, i.e. buildbot.example.org:8007
</ul>

     <li>Create the buildslave

     <p>Now run the 'buildslave' command as follows:

     <pre class="example">          buildslave create-slave <var>BASEDIR</var> <var>MASTERHOST</var>:<var>PORT</var> <var>SLAVENAME</var> <var>PASSWORD</var>
</pre>
     <p>This will create the base directory and a collection of files inside,
including the <samp><span class="file">buildbot.tac</span></samp> file that contains all the
information you passed to the <code>buildbot</code> command.

     <li>Fill in the hostinfo files

     <p>When it first connects, the buildslave will send a few files up to the
buildmaster which describe the host that it is running on. These files
are presented on the web status display so that developers have more
information to reproduce any test failures that are witnessed by the
buildbot. There are sample files in the <samp><span class="file">info</span></samp> subdirectory of
the buildbot's base directory. You should edit these to correctly
describe you and your host.

     <p><samp><span class="file">BASEDIR/info/admin</span></samp> should contain your name and email address. 
This is the &ldquo;buildslave admin address&rdquo;, and will be visible from the
build status page (so you may wish to munge it a bit if
address-harvesting spambots are a concern).

     <p><samp><span class="file">BASEDIR/info/host</span></samp> should be filled with a brief description of
the host: OS, version, memory size, CPU speed, versions of relevant
libraries installed, and finally the version of the buildbot code
which is running the buildslave.

     <p>The optional <samp><span class="file">BASEDIR/info/access_uri</span></samp> can specify a URI which will
connect a user to the machine.  Many systems accept <code>ssh://hostname</code> URIs
for this purpose.

     <p>If you run many buildslaves, you may want to create a single
<samp><span class="file">~buildslave/info</span></samp> file and share it among all the buildslaves
with symlinks.

        </ol>
