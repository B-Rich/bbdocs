<h4 class="subsection">3.1.3 How Different VC Systems Specify Sources</h4>

<p>For CVS, the static specifications are <code>repository</code> and
<code>module</code>. In addition to those, each build uses a timestamp (or
omits the timestamp to mean <code>the latest</code>) and <code>branch tag</code>
(which defaults to HEAD). These parameters collectively specify a set
of sources from which a build may be performed.

   <p><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> combines the
repository, module, and branch into a single <code>Subversion URL</code>
parameter. Within that scope, source checkouts can be specified by a
numeric <code>revision number</code> (a repository-wide
monotonically-increasing marker, such that each transaction that
changes the repository is indexed by a different revision number), or
a revision timestamp. When branches are used, the repository and
module form a static <code>baseURL</code>, while each build has a
<code>revision number</code> and a <code>branch</code> (which defaults to a
statically-specified <code>defaultBranch</code>). The <code>baseURL</code> and
<code>branch</code> are simply concatenated together to derive the
<code>svnurl</code> to use for the checkout.

   <p><a href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> is similar. The server
is specified through a <code>P4PORT</code> parameter. Module and branch
are specified in a single depot path, and revisions are
depot-wide. When branches are used, the <code>p4base</code> and
<code>defaultBranch</code> are concatenated together to produce the depot
path.

   <p><a href="http://wiki.gnuarch.org/">Arch</a> and
<a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a> specify a repository by
URL, as well as a <code>version</code> which is kind of like a branch name. 
Arch uses the word <code>archive</code> to represent the repository. Arch
lets you push changes from one archive to another, removing the strict
centralization required by CVS and SVN. It retains the distinction
between repository and working directory that most other VC systems
use. For complex multi-module directory structures, Arch has a
built-in <code>build config</code> layer with which the checkout process has
two steps. First, an initial bootstrap checkout is performed to
retrieve a set of build-config files. Second, one of these files is
used to figure out which archives/modules should be used to populate
subdirectories of the initial checkout.

   <p>Builders which use Arch and Bazaar therefore have a static archive
<code>url</code>, and a default &ldquo;branch&rdquo; (which is a string that specifies
a complete category&ndash;branch&ndash;version triple). Each build can have its
own branch (the category&ndash;branch&ndash;version string) to override the
default, as well as a revision number (which is turned into a
&ndash;patch-NN suffix when performing the checkout).

   <p><a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org">Bzr</a> (which is a descendant of
Arch/Bazaar, and is frequently referred to as &ldquo;Bazaar&rdquo;) has the same
sort of repository-vs-workspace model as Arch, but the repository data
can either be stored inside the working directory or kept elsewhere
(either on the same machine or on an entirely different machine). For
the purposes of Buildbot (which never commits changes), the repository
is specified with a URL and a revision number.

   <p>The most common way to obtain read-only access to a bzr tree is via
HTTP, simply by making the repository visible through a web server
like Apache. Bzr can also use FTP and SFTP servers, if the buildslave
process has sufficient privileges to access them. Higher performance
can be obtained by running a special Bazaar-specific server. None of
these matter to the buildbot: the repository URL just has to match the
kind of server being used. The <code>repoURL</code> argument provides the
location of the repository.

   <p>Branches are expressed as subdirectories of the main central
repository, which means that if branches are being used, the BZR step
is given a <code>baseURL</code> and <code>defaultBranch</code> instead of getting
the <code>repoURL</code> argument.

   <p><a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> doesn't really have the
notion of a single master repository. Nor does it really have
branches. In Darcs, each working directory is also a repository, and
there are operations to push and pull patches from one of these
<code>repositories</code> to another. For the Buildbot's purposes, all you
need to do is specify the URL of a repository that you want to build
from. The build slave will then pull the latest patches from that
repository and build them. Multiple branches are implemented by using
multiple repositories (possibly living on the same server).

   <p>Builders which use Darcs therefore have a static <code>repourl</code> which
specifies the location of the repository. If branches are being used,
the source Step is instead configured with a <code>baseURL</code> and a
<code>defaultBranch</code>, and the two strings are simply concatenated
together to obtain the repository's URL. Each build then has a
specific branch which replaces <code>defaultBranch</code>, or just uses the
default one. Instead of a revision number, each build can have a
&ldquo;context&rdquo;, which is a string that records all the patches that are
present in a given tree (this is the output of <samp><span class="command">darcs changes
--context</span></samp>, and is considerably less concise than, e.g. Subversion's
revision number, but the patch-reordering flexibility of Darcs makes
it impossible to provide a shorter useful specification).

   <p><a href="http://selenic.com/mercurial">Mercurial</a> is like Darcs, in that
each branch is stored in a separate repository. The <code>repourl</code>,
<code>baseURL</code>, and <code>defaultBranch</code> arguments are all handled the
same way as with Darcs. The &ldquo;revision&rdquo;, however, is the hash
identifier returned by <samp><span class="command">hg identify</span></samp>.

   <p><a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> also follows a decentralized model, and
each repository can have several branches and tags. The source Step is
configured with a static <code>repourl</code> which specifies the location
of the repository. In addition, an optional <code>branch</code> parameter
can be specified to check out code from a specific branch instead of
the default &ldquo;master&rdquo; branch. The &ldquo;revision&rdquo; is specified as a SHA1
hash as returned by e.g. <samp><span class="command">git rev-parse</span></samp>. No attempt is made
to ensure that the specified revision is actually a subset of the
specified branch.
