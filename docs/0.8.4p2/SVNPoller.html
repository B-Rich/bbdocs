<h4 class="subsection">4.7.7 SVNPoller</h4>

<p><a name="index-buildbot_002echanges_002esvnpoller_002eSVNPoller-48"></a>
The <code>buildbot.changes.svnpoller.SVNPoller</code> is a ChangeSource
which periodically polls a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository for new revisions, by running the <code>svn
log</code> command in a subshell. It can watch a single branch or multiple
branches.

   <p><code>SVNPoller</code> accepts the following arguments:

     <dl>
<dt><code>svnurl</code><dd>The base URL path to watch, like
<code>svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk</code>, or
<code>http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/</code>, or even
<code>file:///home/svn/Repository/ProjectA/branches/1.5/</code>. This must
include the access scheme, the location of the repository (both the
hostname for remote ones, and any additional directory names necessary
to get to the repository), and the sub-path within the repository's
virtual filesystem for the project and branch of interest.

     <p>The <code>SVNPoller</code> will only pay attention to files inside the
subdirectory specified by the complete svnurl.

     <br><dt><code>split_file</code><dd>A function to convert pathnames into (branch, relative_pathname)
tuples. Use this to explain your repository's branch-naming policy to
<code>SVNPoller</code>. This function must accept a single string and return
a two-entry tuple. There are a few utility functions in
<code>buildbot.changes.svnpoller</code> that can be used as a
<code>split_file</code> function; see below for details.

     <p>The default value always returns (None, path), which indicates that
all files are on the trunk.

     <p>Subclasses of <code>SVNPoller</code> can override the <code>split_file</code>
method instead of using the <code>split_file=</code> argument.

     <br><dt><code>project</code><dd>Set the name of the project to be used for the <code>SVNPoller</code>. 
This will then be set in any changes generated by the <code>SVNPoller</code>,
and can be used in a Change Filter for triggering particular builders.

     <br><dt><code>svnuser</code><dd>An optional string parameter. If set, the <code>--user</code> argument will
be added to all <code>svn</code> commands. Use this if you have to
authenticate to the svn server before you can do <code>svn info</code> or
<code>svn log</code> commands.

     <br><dt><code>svnpasswd</code><dd>Like <code>svnuser</code>, this will cause a <code>--password</code> argument to
be passed to all svn commands.

     <br><dt><code>pollInterval</code><dd>How often to poll, in seconds. Defaults to 600 (checking once every 10
minutes). Lower this if you want the buildbot to notice changes
faster, raise it if you want to reduce the network and CPU load on
your svn server. Please be considerate of public SVN repositories by
using a large interval when polling them.

     <br><dt><code>histmax</code><dd>The maximum number of changes to inspect at a time. Every POLLINTERVAL
seconds, the <code>SVNPoller</code> asks for the last HISTMAX changes and
looks through them for any ones it does not already know about. If
more than HISTMAX revisions have been committed since the last poll,
older changes will be silently ignored. Larger values of histmax will
cause more time and memory to be consumed on each poll attempt. 
<code>histmax</code> defaults to 100.

     <br><dt><code>svnbin</code><dd>This controls the <code>svn</code> executable to use. If subversion is
installed in a weird place on your system (outside of the
buildmaster's <code>$PATH</code>), use this to tell <code>SVNPoller</code> where
to find it. The default value of &ldquo;svn&rdquo; will almost always be
sufficient.

     <br><dt><code>revlinktmpl</code><dd>This parameter allows a link to be provided for each revision (for example,
to websvn or viewvc).  These links appear anywhere changes are shown, such
as on build or change pages.  The proper form for this parameter is an URL
with the portion that will substitute for a revision number replaced by
&rdquo;%s&rdquo;.  For example, <code>'http://myserver/websvn/revision.php?rev=%s'</code>
could be used to cause revision links to be created to a websvn repository
viewer.

     <br><dt><code>cachepath</code><dd>If specified, buildbot will cache processed revisions between restarts. This
means you don't miss changes that were committed if the master is down for any
reason.

   </dl>

<h3 class="heading">Branches</h3>

<p>Each source file that is tracked by a Subversion repository has a
fully-qualified SVN URL in the following form:
(REPOURL)(PROJECT-plus-BRANCH)(FILEPATH). When you create the
<code>SVNPoller</code>, you give it a <code>svnurl</code> value that includes all
of the REPOURL and possibly some portion of the PROJECT-plus-BRANCH
string. The <code>SVNPoller</code> is responsible for producing Changes that
contain a branch name and a FILEPATH (which is relative to the top of
a checked-out tree). The details of how these strings are split up
depend upon how your repository names its branches.

<h4 class="subheading">PROJECT/BRANCHNAME/FILEPATH repositories</h4>

<p>One common layout is to have all the various projects that share a
repository get a single top-level directory each. Then under a given
project's directory, you get two subdirectories, one named &ldquo;trunk&rdquo;
and another named &ldquo;branches&rdquo;. Under &ldquo;branches&rdquo; you have a bunch of
other directories, one per branch, with names like &ldquo;1.5.x&rdquo; and
&ldquo;testing&rdquo;. It is also common to see directories like &ldquo;tags&rdquo; and
&ldquo;releases&rdquo; next to &ldquo;branches&rdquo; and &ldquo;trunk&rdquo;.

   <p>For example, the Twisted project has a subversion server on
&ldquo;svn.twistedmatrix.com&rdquo; that hosts several sub-projects. The
repository is available through a SCHEME of &ldquo;svn:&rdquo;. The primary
sub-project is Twisted, of course, with a repository root of
&ldquo;svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted&rdquo;. Another sub-project is
Informant, with a root of
&ldquo;svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Informant&rdquo;, etc. Inside any
checked-out Twisted tree, there is a file named bin/trial (which is
used to run unit test suites).

   <p>The trunk for Twisted is in
&ldquo;svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk&rdquo;, and the
fully-qualified SVN URL for the trunk version of <code>trial</code> would be
&ldquo;svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk/bin/trial&rdquo;. The same
SVNURL for that file on a branch named &ldquo;1.5.x&rdquo; would be
&ldquo;svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/branches/1.5.x/bin/trial&rdquo;.

   <p>To set up a <code>SVNPoller</code> that watches the Twisted trunk (and
nothing else), we would use the following:

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller
     c['change_source'] = SVNPoller("svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk")
</pre>
   <p>In this case, every Change that our <code>SVNPoller</code> produces will
have <code>.branch=None</code>, to indicate that the Change is on the trunk. 
No other sub-projects or branches will be tracked.

   <p>If we want our ChangeSource to follow multiple branches, we have to do
two things. First we have to change our <code>svnurl=</code> argument to
watch more than just &ldquo;.../Twisted/trunk&rdquo;. We will set it to
&ldquo;.../Twisted&rdquo; so that we'll see both the trunk and all the branches. 
Second, we have to tell <code>SVNPoller</code> how to split the
(PROJECT-plus-BRANCH)(FILEPATH) strings it gets from the repository
out into (BRANCH) and (FILEPATH) pairs.

   <p>We do the latter by providing a &ldquo;split_file&rdquo; function. This function
is responsible for splitting something like
&ldquo;branches/1.5.x/bin/trial&rdquo; into <code>branch</code>=&rdquo;branches/1.5.x&rdquo; and
<code>filepath</code>=&rdquo;bin/trial&rdquo;. This function is always given a string
that names a file relative to the subdirectory pointed to by the
<code>SVNPoller</code>'s <code>svnurl=</code> argument. It is expected to return a
(BRANCHNAME, FILEPATH) tuple (in which FILEPATH is relative to the
branch indicated), or None to indicate that the file is outside any
project of interest.

   <p>(note that we want to see &ldquo;branches/1.5.x&rdquo; rather than just
&ldquo;1.5.x&rdquo; because when we perform the SVN checkout, we will probably
append the branch name to the baseURL, which requires that we keep the
&ldquo;branches&rdquo; component in there. Other VC schemes use a different
approach towards branches and may not require this artifact.)

   <p>If your repository uses this same PROJECT/BRANCH/FILEPATH naming
scheme, the following function will work:

<pre class="example">     def split_file_branches(path):
         pieces = path.split('/')
         if pieces[0] == 'trunk':
             return (None, '/'.join(pieces[1:]))
         elif pieces[0] == 'branches':
             return ('/'.join(pieces[0:2]),
                     '/'.join(pieces[2:]))
         else:
             return None
</pre>
   <p>This function is provided as
<code>buildbot.changes.svnpoller.split_file_branches</code> for your
convenience. So to have our Twisted-watching <code>SVNPoller</code> follow
multiple branches, we would use this:

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller, split_file_branches
     c['change_source'] = SVNPoller("svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted",
                                    split_file=split_file_branches)
</pre>
   <p>Changes for all sorts of branches (with names like &ldquo;branches/1.5.x&rdquo;,
and None to indicate the trunk) will be delivered to the Schedulers. 
Each Scheduler is then free to use or ignore each branch as it sees
fit.

<h4 class="subheading">BRANCHNAME/PROJECT/FILEPATH repositories</h4>

<p>Another common way to organize a Subversion repository is to put the
branch name at the top, and the projects underneath. This is
especially frequent when there are a number of related sub-projects
that all get released in a group.

   <p>For example, Divmod.org hosts a project named &ldquo;Nevow&rdquo; as well as one
named &ldquo;Quotient&rdquo;. In a checked-out Nevow tree there is a directory
named &ldquo;formless&rdquo; that contains a python source file named
&ldquo;webform.py&rdquo;. This repository is accessible via webdav (and thus
uses an &ldquo;http:&rdquo; scheme) through the divmod.org hostname. There are
many branches in this repository, and they use a
(BRANCHNAME)/(PROJECT) naming policy.

   <p>The fully-qualified SVN URL for the trunk version of webform.py is
<code>http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Nevow/formless/webform.py</code>. 
You can do an <code>svn co</code> with that URL and get a copy of the latest
version. The 1.5.x branch version of this file would have a URL of
<code>http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/branches/1.5.x/Nevow/formless/webform.py</code>. 
The whole Nevow trunk would be checked out with
<code>http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Nevow</code>, while the Quotient
trunk would be checked out using
<code>http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Quotient</code>.

   <p>Now suppose we want to have an <code>SVNPoller</code> that only cares about
the Nevow trunk. This case looks just like the PROJECT/BRANCH layout
described earlier:

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller
     c['change_source'] = SVNPoller("http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Nevow")
</pre>
   <p>But what happens when we want to track multiple Nevow branches? We
have to point our <code>svnurl=</code> high enough to see all those
branches, but we also don't want to include Quotient changes (since
we're only building Nevow). To accomplish this, we must rely upon the
<code>split_file</code> function to help us tell the difference between
files that belong to Nevow and those that belong to Quotient, as well
as figuring out which branch each one is on.

<pre class="example">     from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller
     c['change_source'] = SVNPoller("http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod",
                                    split_file=my_file_splitter)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>my_file_splitter</code> function will be called with
repository-relative pathnames like:

     <dl>
<dt><code>trunk/Nevow/formless/webform.py</code><dd>This is a Nevow file, on the trunk. We want the Change that includes this
to see a filename of <code>formless/webform.py"</code>, and a branch of None

     <br><dt><code>branches/1.5.x/Nevow/formless/webform.py</code><dd>This is a Nevow file, on a branch. We want to get
branch=&rdquo;branches/1.5.x&rdquo; and filename=&rdquo;formless/webform.py&rdquo;.

     <br><dt><code>trunk/Quotient/setup.py</code><dd>This is a Quotient file, so we want to ignore it by having
<code>my_file_splitter</code> return None.

     <br><dt><code>branches/1.5.x/Quotient/setup.py</code><dd>This is also a Quotient file, which should be ignored. 
</dl>

   <p>The following definition for <code>my_file_splitter</code> will do the job:

<pre class="example">     def my_file_splitter(path):
         pieces = path.split('/')
         if pieces[0] == 'trunk':
             branch = None
             pieces.pop(0) # remove 'trunk'
         elif pieces[0] == 'branches':
             pieces.pop(0) # remove 'branches'
             # grab branch name
             branch = 'branches/' + pieces.pop(0)
         else:
             return None # something weird
         projectname = pieces.pop(0)
         if projectname != 'Nevow':
             return None # wrong project
         return (branch, '/'.join(pieces))
</pre>
   </body></html>
