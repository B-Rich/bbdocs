<h5 class="subsubsection">4.14.1.1 Buildbot Web Resources</h5>

<p>Certain URLs are &ldquo;magic&rdquo;, and the pages they serve are created by
code in various classes in the <samp><span class="file">buildbot.status.web</span></samp> package
instead of being read from disk. The most common way to access these
pages is for the buildmaster admin to write or modify the
<samp><span class="file">index.html</span></samp> page to contain links to them. Of course other
project web pages can contain links to these buildbot pages as well.

   <p>Many pages can be modified by adding query arguments to the URL. For
example, a page which shows the results of the most recent build
normally does this for all builders at once. But by appending
&ldquo;?builder=i386&rdquo; to the end of the URL, the page will show only the
results for the &ldquo;i386&rdquo; builder. When used in this way, you can add
multiple &ldquo;builder=&rdquo; arguments to see multiple builders. Remembering
that URL query arguments are separated <em>from each other</em> with
ampersands, a URL that ends in &ldquo;?builder=i386&amp;builder=ppc&rdquo; would
show builds for just those two Builders.

   <p>The <code>branch=</code> query argument can be used on some pages. This
filters the information displayed by that page down to only the builds
or changes which involved the given branch. Use <code>branch=trunk</code> to
reference the trunk: if you aren't intentionally using branches,
you're probably using trunk. Multiple <code>branch=</code> arguments can be
used to examine multiple branches at once (so appending
<code>?branch=foo&amp;branch=bar</code> to the URL will show builds involving
either branch). No <code>branch=</code> arguments means to show builds and
changes for all branches.

   <p>Some pages may include the Builder name or the build number in the
main part of the URL itself. For example, a page that describes Build
#7 of the &ldquo;i386&rdquo; builder would live at <samp><span class="file">/builders/i386/builds/7</span></samp>.

   <p>The table below lists all of the internal pages and the URLs that can
be used to access them.

     <dl>
<dt><code>/waterfall</code><dd>
This provides a chronologically-oriented display of the activity of
all builders. It is the same display used by the Waterfall display.

     <p>By adding one or more &ldquo;builder=&rdquo; query arguments, the Waterfall is
restricted to only showing information about the given Builders. By
adding one or more &ldquo;branch=&rdquo; query arguments, the display is
restricted to showing information about the given branches. In
addition, adding one or more &ldquo;category=&rdquo; query arguments to the URL
will limit the display to Builders that were defined with one of the
given categories.

     <p>A 'show_events=true' query argument causes the display to include
non-Build events, like slaves attaching and detaching, as well as
reconfiguration events. 'show_events=false' hides these events. The
default is to show them.

     <p>By adding the 'failures_only=true' query argument, the Waterfall is
restricted to only showing information about the builders that
are currently failing. A builder is considered failing if the
last finished build was not successful, a step in the current
build(s) is failing, or if the builder is offline.

     <p>The <code>last_time=</code>, <code>first_time=</code>, and <code>show_time=</code>
arguments will control what interval of time is displayed. The default
is to show the latest events, but these can be used to look at earlier
periods in history. The <code>num_events=</code> argument also provides a
limit on the size of the displayed page.

     <p>The Waterfall has references to resources many of the other portions
of the URL space: <samp><span class="file">/builders</span></samp> for access to individual builds,
<samp><span class="file">/changes</span></samp> for access to information about source code changes,
etc.

     <br><dt><code>/grid</code><dd>
This provides a chronologically oriented display of builders, by
revision.  The builders are listed down the left side of the page,
and the revisions are listed across the top.

     <p>By adding one ore more &ldquo;category=&rdquo; arguments the grid will be
restricted to revisions in those categories.

     <p>A &ldquo;width=N&rdquo; argument will limit the number of revisions shown to N,
defaulting to 5.

     <p>A &ldquo;branch=BRANCHNAME&rdquo; argument will limit the grid to revisions on
branch BRANCHNAME.

     <br><dt><code>/tgrid</code><dd>
The Transposed Grid is similar to the standard grid, but, as the name
implies, transposes the grid: the revisions are listed down the left side
of the page, and the build hosts are listed across the top.  It accepts
the same query arguments. The exception being that instead of &ldquo;width&rdquo;
the argument is named &ldquo;length.&rdquo;

     <p>This page also has a &ldquo;rev_order=&rdquo; query argument that
lets you change in what order revisions are shown. 
Valid values are &ldquo;asc&rdquo; (ascending, oldest revision first)
and &ldquo;desc&rdquo; (descending, newest revision first).

     <br><dt><code>/console</code><dd>
EXPERIMENTAL: This provides a developer-oriented display of the the last
changes and how they affected the builders.

     <p>It allows a developer to quickly see the status of each builder for the
first build including his or her change. A green box means that the change
succeeded for all the steps for a given builder. A red box means that
the changed introduced a new regression on a builder. An orange box
means that at least one of the test failed, but it was also failing
in the previous build, so it is not possible to see if there was any
regressions from this change. Finally a yellow box means that the test
is in progress.

     <p>By adding one or more &ldquo;builder=&rdquo; query arguments, the Console view is
restricted to only showing information about the given Builders. Adding a
&ldquo;repository=&rdquo; argument will limit display to a given repository. By
adding a &ldquo;branch=&rdquo; query argument, the display is
restricted to showing information about the given branch. In
addition, adding one or more &ldquo;category=&rdquo; query arguments to the URL
will limit the display to Builders that were defined with one of the
given categories.

     <p>By adding one or more &ldquo;name=&rdquo; query arguments to the URL, the console view is
restricted to only showing changes made by the given users.

     <p>NOTE: To use this page, your buildbot.css file in public_html must be the one
found in <samp><span class="file">master/buildbot/status/web/files/default.css</span></samp>.  This is the
default for new installs, but upgrades of very old installs of Buildbot may
need to manually fix the CSS file.

     <p>The console view is still in development. At this moment by default the view
sorts revisions lexically, which can lead to odd behavior with non-integer
revisions (e.g., git), or with integer revisions of different length (e.g., 999
and 1000).  It also has some issues with displaying multiple braches at the
same time. If you do have multiple branches, you should use the &ldquo;branch=&rdquo;
query argument.  The <code>order_console_by_time</code> option may help sorting
revisions, although it depends on the date being set correctly in each commit:

     <pre class="example">          w = html.WebStatus(http_port=8080, order_console_by_time=True)
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>/rss</code><dd>
This provides a rss feed summarizing all failed builds. The same
query-arguments used by 'waterfall' can be added to filter the
feed output.

     <br><dt><code>/atom</code><dd>
This provides an atom feed summarizing all failed builds. The same
query-arguments used by 'waterfall' can be added to filter the feed
output.

     <br><dt><code>/json</code><dd>
This view provides quick access to Buildbot status information in a form that
is easiliy digested from other programs, including JavaScript.  See
<code>/json/help</code> for detailed interactive documentation of the output formats
for this view.

     <br><dt><code>/buildstatus?builder=$BUILDERNAME&amp;number=$BUILDNUM</code><dd>
This displays a waterfall-like chronologically-oriented view of all the
steps for a given build number on a given builder.

     <br><dt><code>/builders/$BUILDERNAME</code><dd>
This describes the given Builder, and provides buttons to force a
build.  A <code>numbuilds=</code> argument will control how many build lines
are displayed (5 by default).

     <br><dt><code>/builders/$BUILDERNAME/builds/$BUILDNUM</code><dd>
This describes a specific Build.

     <br><dt><code>/builders/$BUILDERNAME/builds/$BUILDNUM/steps/$STEPNAME</code><dd>
This describes a specific BuildStep.

     <br><dt><code>/builders/$BUILDERNAME/builds/$BUILDNUM/steps/$STEPNAME/logs/$LOGNAME</code><dd>
This provides an HTML representation of a specific logfile.

     <br><dt><code>/builders/$BUILDERNAME/builds/$BUILDNUM/steps/$STEPNAME/logs/$LOGNAME/text</code><dd>
This returns the logfile as plain text, without any HTML coloring
markup. It also removes the &ldquo;headers&rdquo;, which are the lines that
describe what command was run and what the environment variable
settings were like. This maybe be useful for saving to disk and
feeding to tools like 'grep'.

     <br><dt><code>/changes</code><dd>
This provides a brief description of the ChangeSource in use
(see <a href="Change-Sources.html#Change-Sources">Change Sources</a>).

     <br><dt><code>/changes/NN</code><dd>
This shows detailed information about the numbered Change: who was the
author, what files were changed, what revision number was represented,
etc.

     <br><dt><code>/buildslaves</code><dd>
This summarizes each BuildSlave, including which Builders are
configured to use it, whether the buildslave is currently connected or
not, and host information retrieved from the buildslave itself.

     <p>A &ldquo;no_builders=1&ldquo; URL argument will omit the builders column.  This is
useful if each buildslave is assigned to a large number of builders.

     <br><dt><code>/one_line_per_build</code><dd>
This page shows one line of text for each build, merging information
from all Builders<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Each line specifies
the name of the Builder, the number of the Build, what revision it
used, and a summary of the results. Successful builds are in green,
while failing builds are in red. The date and time of the build are
added to the right-hand edge of the line. The lines are ordered by
build finish timestamp.

     <p>One or more <code>builder=</code> or <code>branch=</code> arguments can be used to
restrict the list. In addition, a <code>numbuilds=</code> argument will
control how many lines are displayed (20 by default).

     <br><dt><code>/builders</code><dd>
This page shows a small table, with one box for each Builder,
containing the results of the most recent Build. It does not show the
individual steps, or the current status. This is a simple summary of
buildbot status: if this page is green, then all tests are passing.

     <p>As with <code>/one_line_per_build</code>, this page will also honor
<code>builder=</code> and <code>branch=</code> arguments.

     <br><dt><code>/about</code><dd>
This page gives a brief summary of the Buildbot itself: software
version, versions of some libraries that the Buildbot depends upon,
etc. It also contains a link to the buildbot.net home page.

   </dl>

   <p>There are also a set of web-status resources that are intended for use
by other programs, rather than humans.

     <dl>
<dt><code>/change_hook</code><dd>
This provides an endpoint for web-based source change notification. 
It is used by github and contrib/post_build_request.py. 
See <a href="Change-Hooks.html#Change-Hooks">Change Hooks</a> for more details.
