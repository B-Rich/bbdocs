<h4 class="subsection">4.6.2 Multi-master mode</h4>

<p>Normally buildbot operates using a single master process that uses the
configured database to save state.

   <p>It is possible to configure buildbot to have multiple master processes that
share state in the same database.  This has been well tested using a MySQL
database.  There are several benefits of Multi-master mode:
     <ul>
<li>You can have large numbers of build slaves handling the same queue of build
requests.  A single master can only handle so many slaves (the number is based
on a number of factors including type of builds, number of builds, and master
and slave IO and CPU capacity - there is no fixed formula).  By adding another
master which shares the queue of build requests, you can attach more slaves to
this additional master, and increase your build throughput.

     <li>You can shut one master down to do maintenance, and other masters will continue
to do builds.

   </ul>

   <p>State that is shared in the database includes:
     <ul>
<li>List of changes
<li>Scheduler names and internal state
<li>Build requests, including the builder name
</ul>

   <p>Because of this shared state, you are strongly encouraged to:
     <ul>
<li>
Ensure that each named scheduler runs on only one master.  If the same
scheduler runs on multiple masters, it will trigger duplicate builds and may
produce other undesirable behaviors.

     <li>
Ensure builder names are unique for a given build factory implementation.  You
can have the same builder name configured on many masters, but if the build
factories differ, you will get different results depending on which master
claims the build.

   </ul>

   <p>One suggested configuration is to have one buildbot master configured with
just the scheduler and change sources; and then other masters configured
with just the builders.

   <p>To enable multi-master mode in this configuration, you will need to set the
<code>multiMaster</code> option so that buildbot doesn't warn about missing
schedulers or builders.  You will also need to set <code>db_poll_interval</code>
to the masters with only builders check the database for new build requests
at the configured interval.

<pre class="example">     # Enable multiMaster mode; disables warnings about unknown builders and
     # schedulers
     c['multiMaster'] = True
     # Check for new build requests every 60 seconds
     c['db_poll_interval'] = 60
</pre>
   </body></html>
