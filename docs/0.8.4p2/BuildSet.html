<h3 class="section">3.3 BuildSet</h3>

<p><a name="index-BuildSet-9"></a>
A <code>BuildSet</code> is the name given to a set of Builds that all
compile/test the same version of the tree on multiple Builders. In
general, all these component Builds will perform the same sequence of
Steps, using the same source code, but on different platforms or
against a different set of libraries.

   <p>The <code>BuildSet</code> is tracked as a single unit, which fails if any of
the component Builds have failed, and therefore can succeed only if
<em>all</em> of the component Builds have succeeded. There are two kinds
of status notification messages that can be emitted for a BuildSet:
the <code>firstFailure</code> type (which fires as soon as we know the
BuildSet will fail), and the <code>Finished</code> type (which fires once
the BuildSet has completely finished, regardless of whether the
overall set passed or failed).

   <p>A <code>BuildSet</code> is created with a <em>source stamp</em> tuple of
(branch, revision, changes, patch), some of which may be None, and a
list of Builders on which it is to be run. They are then given to the
BuildMaster, which is responsible for creating a separate
<code>BuildRequest</code> for each Builder.

   <p>There are a couple of different likely values for the
<code>SourceStamp</code>:

     <dl>
<dt><code>(revision=None, changes=[CHANGES], patch=None)</code><dd>This is a <code>SourceStamp</code> used when a series of Changes have
triggered a build. The VC step will attempt to check out a tree that
contains CHANGES (and any changes that occurred before CHANGES, but
not any that occurred after them).

     <br><dt><code>(revision=None, changes=None, patch=None)</code><dd>This builds the most recent code on the default branch. This is the
sort of <code>SourceStamp</code> that would be used on a Build that was
triggered by a user request, or a Periodic scheduler. It is also
possible to configure the VC Source Step to always check out the
latest sources rather than paying attention to the Changes in the
SourceStamp, which will result in same behavior as this.

     <br><dt><code>(branch=BRANCH, revision=None, changes=None, patch=None)</code><dd>This builds the most recent code on the given BRANCH. Again, this is
generally triggered by a user request or Periodic build.

     <br><dt><code>(revision=REV, changes=None, patch=(LEVEL, DIFF, SUBDIR_ROOT))</code><dd>This checks out the tree at the given revision REV, then applies a
patch (using <code>patch -pLEVEL &lt;DIFF</code>) from inside the relative
directory SUBDIR_ROOT. Item SUBDIR_ROOT is optional and defaults to the
builder working directory. The <a href="try.html#try">try</a> feature uses this kind of
<code>SourceStamp</code>. If <code>patch</code> is None, the patching step is
bypassed.

   </dl>

   <p>The buildmaster is responsible for turning the <code>BuildSet</code> into a
set of <code>BuildRequest</code> objects and queueing them on the
appropriate Builders.
