<h4 class="subsection">2.6.2 Upgrading a Buildmaster to Buildbot-0.8.0</h4>

<p>Buildbot-0.8.0 introduces a database backend, which is SQLite by default.  The
<code>upgrade-master</code> command will automatically create and populate this
database with the changes the buildmaster has seen.  Note that, as of this
release, build history is <i>not</i> contained in the database, and is thus not
migrated.

   <p>The upgrade process renames the Changes pickle (<code>$basedir/changes.pck</code>) to
<code>changes.pck.old</code> once the upgrade is complete.  To reverse the upgrade,
simply downgrade Buildbot and move this file back to its original name.  You
may also wish to delete the state database (<code>state.sqlite</code>).

<h3 class="heading">Upgrading into a non-SQLite database</h3>

<p>If you are not using sqlite, you will need to add an entry into your
<samp><span class="file">master.cfg</span></samp> to reflect the database version you are using. The upgrade
process does <i>not</i> edit your <samp><span class="file">master.cfg</span></samp> for you. So something like:

<pre class="example">     # for using mysql:
     c['db_url'] = 'mysql://bbuser:&lt;password&gt;@localhost/buildbot'
</pre>
   <p>Once the parameter has been added, invoke <code>upgrade-master</code> with the
<code>--db</code> parameter, e.g.,

<pre class="example">     buildbot upgrade-master --db=mysql://bbuser:&lt;password&gt;@localhost/buildbot
</pre>
   <p>The <code>--db</code> option must match the <code>c['db_url']</code> exactly.

   <p>See see <a href="Database-Specification.html#Database-Specification">Database Specification</a> for more options to specify a database.

<h3 class="heading">Change Encoding Issues</h3>

<p>The upgrade process assumes that strings in your Changes pickle are encoded in
UTF-8 (or plain ASCII).  If this is not the case, and if there are non-UTF-8
characters in the pickle, the upgrade will fail with a suitable error message. 
If this occurs, you have two options.  If the change history is not important
to your purpose, you can simply delete <code>changes.pck</code>.

   <p>If you would like to keep the change history, then you will need to figure out
which encoding is in use, and use <code>contrib/fix_changes_pickle_encoding.py</code>
(see <a href="Contrib-Scripts.html#Contrib-Scripts">Contrib Scripts</a>) to rewrite the changes pickle into Unicode before
upgrading the master.  A typical invocation (with Mac-Roman encoding) might
look like:

<pre class="example">     $ python $buildbot/contrib/fix_changes_pickle_encoding.py changes.pck macroman
     decoding bytestrings in changes.pck using macroman
     converted 11392 strings
     backing up changes.pck to changes.pck.old
</pre>
   <p>If your Changes pickle uses multiple encodings, you're on your own, but the
script in contrib may provide a good starting point for the fix.
