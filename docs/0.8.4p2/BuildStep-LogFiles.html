<h5 class="subsubsection">4.12.13.2 BuildStep LogFiles</h5>

<p>Each BuildStep has a collection of &ldquo;logfiles&rdquo;. Each one has a short
name, like &ldquo;stdio&rdquo; or &ldquo;warnings&rdquo;. Each LogFile contains an
arbitrary amount of text, usually the contents of some output file
generated during a build or test step, or a record of everything that
was printed to stdout/stderr during the execution of some command.

   <p>These LogFiles are stored to disk, so they can be retrieved later.

   <p>Each can contain multiple &ldquo;channels&rdquo;, generally limited to three
basic ones: stdout, stderr, and &ldquo;headers&rdquo;. For example, when a
ShellCommand runs, it writes a few lines to the &ldquo;headers&rdquo; channel to
indicate the exact argv strings being run, which directory the command
is being executed in, and the contents of the current environment
variables. Then, as the command runs, it adds a lot of &ldquo;stdout&rdquo; and
&ldquo;stderr&rdquo; messages. When the command finishes, a final &ldquo;header&rdquo;
line is added with the exit code of the process.

   <p>Status display plugins can format these different channels in
different ways. For example, the web page shows LogFiles as text/html,
with header lines in blue text, stdout in black, and stderr in red. A
different URL is available which provides a text/plain format, in
which stdout and stderr are collapsed together, and header lines are
stripped completely. This latter option makes it easy to save the
results to a file and run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> or whatever against the
output.

   <p>Each BuildStep contains a mapping (implemented in a python dictionary)
from LogFile name to the actual LogFile objects. Status plugins can
get a list of LogFiles to display, for example, a list of HREF links
that, when clicked, provide the full contents of the LogFile.

<h3 class="heading">Using LogFiles in custom BuildSteps</h3>

<p>The most common way for a custom BuildStep to use a LogFile is to
summarize the results of a ShellCommand (after the command has
finished running). For example, a compile step with thousands of lines
of output might want to create a summary of just the warning messages. 
If you were doing this from a shell, you would use something like:

<pre class="example">     grep "warning:" output.log &gt;warnings.log
</pre>
   <p>In a custom BuildStep, you could instead create a &ldquo;warnings&rdquo; LogFile
that contained the same text. To do this, you would add code to your
<code>createSummary</code> method that pulls lines from the main output log
and creates a new LogFile with the results:

<pre class="example">         import StringIO
         def createSummary(self, log):
             warnings = []
             sio = StringIO.StringIO(log.getText())
             for line in sio.readlines():
                 if "warning:" in line:
                     warnings.append()
             self.addCompleteLog('warnings', "".join(warnings))
</pre>
   <p>This example uses the <code>addCompleteLog</code> method, which creates a
new LogFile, puts some text in it, and then &ldquo;closes&rdquo; it, meaning
that no further contents will be added. This LogFile will appear in
the HTML display under an HREF with the name &ldquo;warnings&rdquo;, since that
is the name of the LogFile.

   <p>You can also use <code>addHTMLLog</code> to create a complete (closed)
LogFile that contains HTML instead of plain text. The normal LogFile
will be HTML-escaped if presented through a web page, but the HTML
LogFile will not. At the moment this is only used to present a pretty
HTML representation of an otherwise ugly exception traceback when
something goes badly wrong during the BuildStep.

   <p>In contrast, you might want to create a new LogFile at the beginning
of the step, and add text to it as the command runs. You can create
the LogFile and attach it to the build by calling <code>addLog</code>, which
returns the LogFile object. You then add text to this LogFile by
calling methods like <code>addStdout</code> and <code>addHeader</code>. When you
are done, you must call the <code>finish</code> method so the LogFile can be
closed. It may be useful to create and populate a LogFile like this
from a LogObserver method See <a href="Adding-LogObservers.html#Adding-LogObservers">Adding LogObservers</a>.

   <p>The <code>logfiles=</code> argument to <code>ShellCommand</code> (see
see <a href="ShellCommand.html#ShellCommand">ShellCommand</a>) creates new LogFiles and fills them in realtime
by asking the buildslave to watch a actual file on disk. The
buildslave will look for additions in the target file and report them
back to the BuildStep. These additions will be added to the LogFile by
calling <code>addStdout</code>. These secondary LogFiles can be used as the
source of a LogObserver just like the normal &ldquo;stdio&rdquo; LogFile.
