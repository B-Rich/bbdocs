<h5 class="subsubsection">4.12.4.1 Using ShellCommands</h5>

<p><a name="index-buildbot_002esteps_002eshell_002eShellCommand-100"></a>
This is a useful base class for just about everything you might want
to do during a build (except for the initial source checkout). It runs
a single command in a child shell on the buildslave. All stdout/stderr
is recorded into a LogFile. The step finishes with a status of FAILURE
if the command's exit code is non-zero, otherwise it has a status of
SUCCESS.

   <p>The preferred way to specify the command is with a list of argv strings,
since this allows for spaces in filenames and avoids doing any fragile
shell-escaping. You can also specify the command with a single string, in
which case the string is given to '/bin/sh -c COMMAND' for parsing.

   <p>On Windows, commands are run via <code>cmd.exe /c</code> which works well. However,
if you're running a batch file, the error level does not get propagated
correctly unless you add 'call' before your batch file's name:
<code>cmd=['call', 'myfile.bat', ...]</code>.

   <p><code>ShellCommand</code> arguments:

     <dl>
<dt><code>command</code><dd>a list of strings (preferred) or single string (discouraged) which
specifies the command to be run. A list of strings is preferred
because it can be used directly as an argv array. Using a single
string (with embedded spaces) requires the buildslave to pass the
string to /bin/sh for interpretation, which raises all sorts of
difficult questions about how to escape or interpret shell
metacharacters.

     <br><dt><code>workdir</code><dd>All ShellCommands are run by default in the &ldquo;workdir&rdquo;, which
defaults to the &ldquo;<samp><span class="file">build</span></samp>&rdquo; subdirectory of the slave builder's
base directory. The absolute path of the workdir will thus be the
slave's basedir (set as an option to <code>buildbot create-slave</code>,
see <a href="Creating-a-buildslave.html#Creating-a-buildslave">Creating a buildslave</a>) plus the builder's basedir (set in the
builder's <code>c['builddir']</code> key in master.cfg) plus the workdir
itself (a class-level attribute of the BuildFactory, defaults to
&ldquo;<samp><span class="file">build</span></samp>&rdquo;).

     <p>For example:

     <pre class="example">          f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                                 workdir="build/tests"))
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>env</code><dd>a dictionary of environment strings which will be added to the child
command's environment. For example, to run tests with a different i18n
language setting, you might use

     <pre class="example">          f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                                 env={'LANG': 'fr_FR'}))
</pre>
     <p>These variable settings will override any existing ones in the
buildslave's environment or the environment specified in the
Builder. The exception is PYTHONPATH, which is merged
with (actually prepended to) any existing $PYTHONPATH setting. The
value is treated as a list of directories to prepend, and a single
string is treated like a one-item list. For example, to prepend both
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/python2.3</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/home/buildbot/lib/python</span></samp>
to any existing $PYTHONPATH setting, you would do something like the
following:

     <pre class="example">          f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                        command=["make", "test"],
                        env={'PYTHONPATH': ["/usr/local/lib/python2.3",
                                             "/home/buildbot/lib/python"] }))
</pre>
     <p>Those variables support expansion so that if you just want to prepend
<samp><span class="file">/home/buildbot/bin</span></samp> to the PATH environment variable, you can do
it by putting the value <code>${PATH}</code> at the end of the string like
in the example below. Variables that doesn't exists on the slave will be
replaced by <code>""</code>.

     <pre class="example">          f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                        command=["make", "test"],
                        env={'PATH': "/home/buildbot/bin:${PATH}"}))
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>want_stdout</code><dd>if False, stdout from the child process is discarded rather than being
sent to the buildmaster for inclusion in the step's LogFile.

     <br><dt><code>want_stderr</code><dd>like <code>want_stdout</code> but for stderr. Note that commands run through
a PTY do not have separate stdout/stderr streams: both are merged into
stdout.

     <br><dt><code>usePTY</code><dd>Should this command be run in a pseudo-terminal?  The default is to observe the
configuration of the client (see <a href="Buildslave-Options.html#Buildslave-Options">Buildslave Options</a>), but specifying
<code>True</code> or <code>False</code> here will override the default.  This option is not
available on Windows.

     <p>In general, you do not want to use a pseudo-terminal.  This is <i>only</i> useful
for running commands that require a terminal - for example, testing a
command-line application that will only accept passwords read from a terminal. 
Using a pseudo-terminal brings lots of compatibility problems, and prevents
Buildbot from distinguishing the standard error (red) and standard output
(black) streams.

     <p>In previous versions, the advantage of using a pseudo-terminal was that
&ldquo;grandchild&rdquo; processes were more likely to be cleaned up if the build was
interrupted or times out.  This occurred because using a pseudo-terminal
incidentally puts the command into its own process group.

     <p>As of Buildbot-0.8.4, all commands are placed in process groups, and thus
grandchild processes will be cleaned up properly.

     <br><dt><code>logfiles</code><dd>Sometimes commands will log interesting data to a local file, rather
than emitting everything to stdout or stderr. For example, Twisted's
&ldquo;trial&rdquo; command (which runs unit tests) only presents summary
information to stdout, and puts the rest into a file named
<samp><span class="file">_trial_temp/test.log</span></samp>. It is often useful to watch these files
as the command runs, rather than using <samp><span class="command">/bin/cat</span></samp> to dump
their contents afterwards.

     <p>The <code>logfiles=</code> argument allows you to collect data from these
secondary logfiles in near-real-time, as the step is running. It
accepts a dictionary which maps from a local log name (which is how
the log data is presented in the build results) to either a remote filename
(interpreted relative to the build's working directory), or a dictionary
of options. Each named file will be polled on a regular basis (every couple
of seconds) as the build runs, and any new text will be sent over to the
buildmaster.

     <p>If you provide a dictionary of options instead of a string, you must specify
the <code>filename</code> key. You can optionally provide a <code>follow</code> key which
is a boolean controlling whether a logfile is followed or concatenated in its
entirety.  Following is appropriate for logfiles to which the build step will
append, where the pre-existing contents are not interesting.  The default value
for <code>follow</code> is <code>False</code>, which gives the same behavior as just
providing a string filename.

     <pre class="example">          f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                        command=["make", "test"],
                        logfiles={"triallog": "_trial_temp/test.log"}))
</pre>
     <p>The above example will add a log named 'triallog' on the master, based on
<code>_trial_temp/test.log</code> on the slave.

     <pre class="example">          f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                        command=["make", "test"],
                        logfiles={"triallog": {"filename": "_trial_temp/test.log",
          			       "follow": True,}}))
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>lazylogfiles</code><dd>If set to <code>True</code>, logfiles will be tracked lazily, meaning that they will
only be added when and if something is written to them. This can be used to
suppress the display of empty or missing log files. The default is <code>False</code>.

     <br><dt><code>timeout</code><dd>if the command fails to produce any output for this many seconds, it
is assumed to be locked up and will be killed. This defaults to 1200 seconds. 
Pass <code>None</code> to disable.

     <br><dt><code>maxTime</code><dd>if the command takes longer than this many seconds, it will be killed. This
is disabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>description</code><dd>This will be used to describe the command (on the Waterfall display)
while the command is still running. It should be a single
imperfect-tense verb, like &ldquo;compiling&rdquo; or &ldquo;testing&rdquo;. The preferred
form is a list of short strings, which allows the HTML
displays to create narrower columns by emitting a &lt;br&gt; tag between each
word. You may also provide a single string.

     <br><dt><code>descriptionDone</code><dd>This will be used to describe the command once it has finished. A
simple noun like &ldquo;compile&rdquo; or &ldquo;tests&rdquo; should be used. Like
<code>description</code>, this may either be a list of short strings or a
single string.

     <p>If neither <code>description</code> nor <code>descriptionDone</code> are set, the
actual command arguments will be used to construct the description. 
This may be a bit too wide to fit comfortably on the Waterfall
display.

     <pre class="example">          f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                                 description=["testing"],
                                 descriptionDone=["tests"]))
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>logEnviron</code><dd>If this option is true (the default), then the step's logfile will describe the
environment variables on the slave.  In situations where the environment is not
relevant and is long, it may be easier to set <code>logEnviron=False</code>.
