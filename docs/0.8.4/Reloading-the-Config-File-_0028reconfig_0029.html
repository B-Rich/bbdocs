<h3 class="section">4.5 Reloading the Config File (reconfig)</h3>

<p>If you are on the system hosting the buildmaster, you can send a <code>SIGHUP</code>
signal to it: the <samp><span class="command">buildbot</span></samp> tool has a shortcut for this:

<pre class="example">     buildbot reconfig <var>BASEDIR</var>
</pre>
   <p>This command will show you all of the lines from <samp><span class="file">twistd.log</span></samp>
that relate to the reconfiguration. If there are any problems during
the config-file reload, they will be displayed in these lines.

   <p>When reloading the config file, the buildmaster will endeavor to
change as little as possible about the running system. For example,
although old status targets may be shut down and new ones started up,
any status targets that were not changed since the last time the
config file was read will be left running and untouched. Likewise any
Builders which have not been changed will be left running. If a
Builder is modified (say, the build process is changed) while a Build
is currently running, that Build will keep running with the old
process until it completes. Any previously queued Builds (or Builds
which get queued after the reconfig) will use the new process.

<h3 class="heading">Warning</h3>

<p>Buildbot's reconfiguration system is fragile for a few difficult-to-fix
reasons:

     <ul>
<li>Any modules imported by the configuration file are not automatically reloaded. 
Python modules such as <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lazy-reload">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lazy-reload</a> may help
here, but reloading modules is fraught with subtlties and difficult-to-decipher
failure cases.

     <li>During the reconfiguration, active internal objects are divorced from the service
hierarchy, leading to tracebacks in the web interface and other components. These
are ordinarily transient, but with HTTP connection caching (either by the browser or
an intervening proxy) they can last for a long time.

     <li>If the new configuration file is invalid, it is possible for Buildbot's
internal state to be corrupted, leading to undefined results.  When this
occurs, it is best to restart the mater.

     <li>For more advanced configurations, it is impossible for Buildbot to tell if the
configuration for a builder or scheduler has chanaged, and thus the builder or
scheduler will always be reloaded.  This occurs most commonly when a callable
is passed as a configuration parameter.

   </ul>

   <p>The bbproto project (at <a href="https://github.com/dabrahams/bbproto">https://github.com/dabrahams/bbproto</a>) may help to
construct large (multi-file) configurations which can be effectively reloaded
and reconfigured.

<h3 class="heading">Reconfig by Debug Client</h3>

<p>The debug tool (<code>buildbot debugclient --master HOST:PORT</code>) has a
&ldquo;Reload .cfg&rdquo; button which will also trigger a reload. In the
future, there will be other ways to accomplish this step (probably a
password-protected button on the web page, as well as a privileged IRC
command).
